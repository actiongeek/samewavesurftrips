The title track, with its groovadelic percussion and warped synth work, joins multiple dots between the house and techno scenes past and present to perfection, masterfully linking dancefloor dynamism with playful experimentation. To complement this creative theme, F & L unleashes a focused, powerful, brooding techno energy, building with seductive vocal snippets into a monstrously elegant linear masterpiece. Sounds Like Hollywood is constructed of yet heavier elements, overlaying its super-solid beats with hypnotic melodic loops. For the EPs finale, Techmod continues the theme, upping the funk factor with a superbly energetic, percussive workout topped with explosive synth lines.Since Frankfurt is a historic capital for European Techno, it is no wonder that it also the home to Pascal Dardoufas (aka Pascal FEOS), one of the scenes true originals, and much respected for creating and playing his own very special and individual style of music around the globe for 30 years. Not only a masterful DJ/Producer/Remixer, he also runs his own vibrant levelNONzero label. Firmly staying true to his old-school roots, Pascal remains steadfast to an ethos whereby he sees his work as a mission rather than as a platform to draw attention to himself. His focus always has and always will belong to the dancefloor and The Big Reason EP is a perfect testament to that.","id":125,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI126","released":"2018-9-24","title":"The Big Reason EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":47,"release_code":"BEDDIGI126","release_id":"2395195","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Big Reason","track_length":"5:12"},{"bpm":"126","id":48,"release_code":"BEDDIGI126","release_id":"2395195","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"F & L","track_length":"7:01"},{"bpm":"125","id":49,"release_code":"BEDDIGI126","release_id":"2395195","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Sounds Like Hollywood","track_length":"5:08"},{"bpm":"126","id":50,"release_code":"BEDDIGI126","release_id":"2395195","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Techmod","track_length":"7:11"}]},{"artists":"Edu Imbernon","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c8e054a1-5cb4-4559-8fab-d85950e57c94.jpg","description":"Currently enjoying another scorching summer spell-binding audiences, touring South America and playing some of the best festivals across Europe, Valencian soul stirrer Edu Imbernon takes time to make a return to John Digweeds perennial Bedrock with two outstanding compositions. Evocative, poignant and just on the right side of epic; we guarantee these tracks from the Fayer Records boss will have your dancefloor like emotional putty in your hands. Indenait takes the lead with soft guitar plucks, harmonics and stately 4/4 drive that sets the scene for the rainbow of twinkling vapour trails that follows. A crisp, mournful arpeggio then takes the lead on the breakdown, bringing with it a whole new level of heavy heartedness. A sunrise moment guaranteed.Love Attack follows suit with a rising sense of palpable urgency and yearning. But this time its developed over a slightly pacier, shuffled rhythm that eventually builds into full rolling breakbeat. Backed up with bulbous subs and sinewy acid lines that weave the synth elements together, once again Imbernon drives us into a moving melee of emotions and feelings that explodes on the eventual pay off. If youve heard John or Edu play any time in the last few months, youll already know just how exhilarating these tracks truly are. Designed for long scorching summers, built to last forever; this is the timeless music that Bedrock has built its name on.","id":126,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI125","released":"2018-9-10","title":"Indenait EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"121","id":127,"release_code":"BEDDIGI125","release_id":"2381159","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Indenait","track_length":"9:37"},{"bpm":"124","id":128,"release_code":"BEDDIGI125","release_id":"2381159","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Love Attack","track_length":"7:28"}]},{"artists":"Anormal;Jimmy Van M;Juan Hansen;Ernesto Romeo","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/8ff0f944-5511-4d3c-99c9-f64ab0bc0b98.jpg","description":"Latin Americas pulsating musical heritage and electronic musics universal appeal, has seen Argentina rise up onto the world stage as an ever-evolving hotbed of talent. The fresh, passionate, musical/cultural mix in Buenos Aires and all over the country is going global enter Juan Hansen. The past couple of years have seen this supremely talented, trained composer/musician/vocalist, develop his incredible live sets performances that are rapidly becoming legendary in the clubs of Argentina, guided by an exemplary ethos of mixing genres without prejudice. Now, Bedrock is set to release Juans first ever EP in a perfect collaborative meeting of musical minds with the legendary Jimmy Van M.Kobalt exhibits a distinctly futuristic feel, as its ever-mutating, deeply hypnotic groove is overlaid with incredibly dynamic analog synth work, topped with Juans distinctive, heart-melting vocal contributions quite simply, an epically original creation. Meanwhile, their sparse, stripped-back, percussive Kobalt (Anormal Rework) is a perfect juxtaposition in terms of feel and vibe. Riding a breaking wave and diving deeper into electronic soundscape territory comes Madin (Gala Dub) a more experimental, linear audio excursion, but no less impressive in its outcome. As a mark of this exciting duos boundless creative ideology, Jimmy & Juan decamped to Ernesto Romeos studio (one of the finest analog studios in Argentina) to completely re-record an alternative version of Kobalt. Ernesto is a legend in his own right considered among the pioneers of the scene; a modular synth master as a member of Klauss (since 1988); Carl Craig collaborator on Planet E; and a renowned educator as a professor of synthesis. For this project, the trio set about experimenting and recording layers of live synths to give the track a new vibe, took out original parts, inserted new ideas, edited and tweaked, to end up with an entirely new, deeply delicious Kobalt (Synthwork) version. Every successful collaborative project needs a guiding light, and from his first club experience at 14 years of age at The Bocaccio in Gent, Belgium to his first DJ residency in NYC at the legendary Twilo; through creating the legendary Delta Heavy Tour 2002 with Sasha & John Digweed (31 cities, over 100.000 people, across 60 days), to releasing a multitude of singles, remixes, albums and compilations; Jimmy Van M has a peerless pedigree, having remained at the vanguard of the underground dance industry for more than 20 years. Currently residing in Buenos Aires, he continues to build an enduring legacy, with his recording projects, and is enabling and managing the new music generation through the recently launched Insound Academy (http://insoundacademy.com), as a mentor. With such powerful creative energy joining the past with the future, Argentinas place on the global stage is set to grow even stronger.","id":127,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI124","released":"2018-8-27","title":"Kobalt EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"121","id":215,"release_code":"BEDDIGI124","release_id":"2367496","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Kobalt","track_length":"6:55"},{"bpm":"121","id":216,"release_code":"BEDDIGI124","release_id":"2367496","remix_title":"Gala Dub","title":"Madin","track_length":"8:28"},{"bpm":"121","id":217,"release_code":"BEDDIGI124","release_id":"2367496","remix_title":"Synthwork","title":"Kobalt","track_length":"6:28"},{"bpm":"121","id":218,"release_code":"BEDDIGI124","release_id":"2367496","remix_title":"Anormal Rework","title":"Kobalt","track_length":"7:12"}]},{"artists":"Fairmont","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/d95873ae-3630-46aa-83a6-06fd8f5512c4.jpg","description":"Fresh from a recent appearence on the incendiary Bedrock XX, Fairmont returns to John Digweeds mothership label with two more immaculate immersive originals.Brothers Keeper sets the tone and pace as the Toronto-born rolls out a cosmic juggernaut that builds with star-gazing momentum on every twist and turn.

This latest EP is a showcase of Barrys ever-careful devotion to perfection, a diverse package that displays a unique variety of moods and textures across the landscape of the current electronic scene, stamped unequivocally with his masterful sonic wizardry.Title track Louder Than Silence dives deep into delicious dub territory, with a peerless, controlled display of mood changing electronics, bedded on a spacious head-nodding groove, sprinkled with an ever changing array of FX and a smattering of Barrys own wistful vocals as the track shifts up a gear in the final third. In perfect contrast, the pulsating, jittery tension of Lost Track is a trans-continental express of hissing hi-hat energy, overlaid with the seductive vocals of Taka Boom (recorded by Mark Bell at Blakkat USA in LA). An equally absorbing alternative the soaring, vocal free Deep Mix, is also featured here. Finally, the irresistible, hypnotic pulse of Neutral Density closes the EP, with Barrys deft creative skills subtly blending speedy, linear percussive energy with melodious motifs, founded on a relentlessly dancefloor-driven attitude.Although, perhaps not a household name, Barry Jamieson has been an integral operator within the electronic music scene since the mid-80's. With 30 years worth of exceptional creations as a producer, engineer and artist, many people will have inadvertently come across some of his work for the likes of Madonna, New Order, Depeche Mode, UNKLE and Seal, to name but a handful. Barry has spent the last decade working alongside Sasha and Charlie May (Spooky), recording and mixing much of Sasha's work, including the ground breaking Involver and Involver 2 albums. Most recently, Barry has been working with Sasha and the team again, helping to create Sashas Refracted : Live tour. After his involvement with Sashas Scene Delete album, Barry has helped create the technical side of the Refracted : Live shows, as well as designing all of the sounds for the tour. His production work has earned him a prestigious Grammy nomination, and he also runs his own Circular Sound Recordings (CSR).The Mono Electric Orchestras debut single Blunt Force Trauma appeared in 2012 on Manual Music, featuring an incredible remix from Max Cooper, and was followed that same year by Indifference (after an exquisite rework by Henry Saiz featured on his classic Balance 019 mix album). 2014 saw the project pop up again, this time on Hope Recordings, when Nick Warren featured Uno Momento and Low Ball on his The Soundgarden mix album. Since, then, apart from a couple of remixes for Mike Griego (Replug) and Hal Incandenza (Natura Sonoris), the Mono Electric Orchestra has been silent. Now, in 2018 this crucial creative project returns on Bedrock to showcase more timeless music that stands for pure quality and originality.","id":131,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI121","released":"2018-7-2","title":"Louder Than Silence EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"117","id":256,"release_code":"BEDDIGI121","release_id":"2330747","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Louder Than Silence","track_length":"10:41"},{"bpm":"126","id":257,"release_code":"BEDDIGI121","release_id":"2330747","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Neutral Denisty","track_length":"8:37"},{"bpm":"126","id":258,"release_code":"BEDDIGI121","release_id":"2330747","remix_title":"Deep Vox","title":"Lost Track","track_length":"7:46"},{"bpm":"126","id":259,"release_code":"BEDDIGI121","release_id":"2330747","remix_title":"Deep Mix","title":"Lost Track","track_length":"7:14"}]},{"artists":"John Digweed;Alan Fitzpatrick;Nick Muir;Eagles & Butterflies;Fairmont;Guy J;Hannes Bieger;Ian O'Donovan;Josh Wink;Lee Van Dowski;Marc Romboy;Monkey Safari;Martin Eyerer;Musumeci;Oliver Lieb;Paco Osuna;Pig&Dan;Quivver;Robert Babicz;Ruede Hagelstein;Sam Paganini;Zøe;Yunus Guvenen","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/946c1024-f4a2-4e38-b728-c0d76756b9b3.jpg","description":"Bedrock celebrates 20 years with an outstanding collection of original tracks custom made for this album project.

Greek-born and classically trained, Stelios Vassiloudis has carved his unique path in electronic music by traversing the globe as a DJ and live performer, playing shows in a huge variety of inspirational locations and settings over the years. Concurrently, he has built up a formidable back-catalogue of music on esteemed labels such as Bedrock, Poker Flat, Audiomatique and Moodmusic, among others. His intense passion and drive for innovation in music serves as the fuel to keep Stelios inspired and relevant. Now, entering a new phase of his career, Stelios is currently preparing his sophomore album (and accompanying live show).

A chance meeting with John at last summers Veld Festival led to the Toronto-based artist exchanging emails and sending him some new tracks shed just finished. The rest, as they say, is history. Undoubtedly, Shelley is an upcoming future star of the ever inventive and evolving global Techno scene, having previously impressed with releases on Sians Octopus Recordings. She also recently created a superb guest mix for Transitions Episode 681.\r\n\r\nFor people with open minds and open ears, electronic music doesnt really have borders - blurring boundaries is a given - unrestricted creativity and experimentation is what allows artists to make exceptional music that becomes timeless and treasured. Shelley Johannson is cut from the cloth of the new generation of global techno artists who channel the spirit of classic and timeless music, update it and create new boundless possibilities for the future. Her inimitable dancefloor-driven attitude showcases a creative palette that stands for pure quality and originality, as she boldly walks her own path towards a very bright and highly creative musical future.\r\n\r\nHer EP opens with the heavy kick-led, stripped-back, fizzing percussive energy of Broken City, a track topped with a healthy dose of analogue squelch and deliciously evocative vocal snippets. Nocturnal Bright maintains the focus on a powerful percussive groove, but ups the energy levels and adds some delightful melodic beauty to the proceedings. Slow Rise rides a tricky tightrope - building tension to superb effect as the darkndirty beats spark subtle melodic motifs throughout, creating a distinct emotive edge. Closing out the EP perfectly, Tribaltone is an ever-evolving, percussive workout par excellence as it fires a furnace of energy for an impressive finale.","id":142,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI112","released":"2018-1-8","title":"Tribaltone EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"124","id":560,"release_code":"BEDDIGI112","release_id":"2176873","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Broken City","track_length":"8:17"},{"bpm":"125","id":561,"release_code":"BEDDIGI112","release_id":"2176873","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Nocturnal Bright","track_length":"7:11"},{"bpm":"123","id":562,"release_code":"BEDDIGI112","release_id":"2176873","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Slow Rise","track_length":"6:53"},{"bpm":"125","id":563,"release_code":"BEDDIGI112","release_id":"2176873","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Tribaltone","track_length":"8:15"}]},{"artists":"Guy Mantzur;Darren Emerson;Alan Fitzpatrick;Quivver;Beckers;D-Nox;Jeremy Olander;Cristoph;Monkey Safari;Stelios Vassiloudis;BOg;Tim Engelhardt;Saints & Sinners;Chris Fortier;Andromo;Guy J;Khen;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Jamie Anderson;Harvey McKay;Montel;Fideles;Philipp Straub;Charlie Thorstenson;Lee Van Dowski;Bastian Bux;Gregor Tresher","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/21540726-1074-471c-9da6-313f35a0946d.jpg","description":"The Bedrock Collection 2017 is a great way to finish the year and celebrate some of the great artists and music we've worked with and released in 2017.","id":143,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI111","released":"2017-12-18","title":"Bedrock Collection 2017","tracks":[{"bpm":"123","id":985,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mumbo Jumbo","track_length":"6:33"},{"bpm":"121","id":986,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mondays","track_length":"8:18"},{"bpm":"122","id":987,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Last Dance","track_length":"7:59"},{"bpm":"125","id":988,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Oxy","track_length":"10:32"},{"bpm":"123","id":989,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Blood Orange","track_length":"8:28"},{"bpm":"122","id":990,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Scene 1","track_length":"7:46"},{"bpm":"121","id":991,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Guy Mantzur Remix","title":"Pushing Too Hard","track_length":"10:30"},{"bpm":"122","id":992,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"This Just Then","track_length":"7:08"},{"bpm":"124","id":993,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"2026","track_length":"7:46"},{"bpm":"123","id":994,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mountains Air","track_length":"7:50"},{"bpm":"123","id":995,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"On The Go","track_length":"7:26"},{"bpm":"123","id":996,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Tracer","track_length":"7:31"},{"bpm":"125","id":997,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Darren Emerson Remix","title":"Event Horizon","track_length":"6:40"},{"bpm":"126","id":998,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original","title":"Virus","track_length":"6:47"},{"bpm":"126","id":999,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original","title":"First Light","track_length":"6:56"},{"bpm":"122","id":1000,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original","title":"Moonlight","track_length":"7:36"},{"bpm":"124","id":1001,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original","title":"Flying Dishes","track_length":"8:24"},{"bpm":"122","id":1002,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original","title":"Miracle Of Existence","track_length":"7:28"},{"bpm":"125","id":1003,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Original","title":"Nine Lives","track_length":"7:12"},{"bpm":"126","id":1004,"release_code":"BEDDIGI111","release_id":"2174290","remix_title":"Alan Fitzpatrick's WATB Rework","title":"Goliath","track_length":"7:08"}]},{"artists":"Sahar Z;Stelios Vassiloudis","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/6bbf5699-735c-4ac0-88ec-31db22322b51.jpg","description":"Maybe its a sign of the musical times, or a shift in some artists creative ideology, but, interestingly, it seems that the strength of the numerous collaborative studio partnerships out there seem to be growing and growing. So, as yet another exceptional year of electronic music draws to a close, it seems fitting that the combined talents of Sahar Z & Stelios Vassiloudis should be joined together in a finale release for Bedrock Records in 2017.\r\n\r\nAthenian DJ/Producer Stelios Vassiloudis is a Bedrock regular whose diverse musical palette always sees him create enthralling, highly memorable tracks. Having recently returned to the studio after an extended musical hiatus, his solo releases throughout 2017 have been exceptional, further establishing him as one of the scenes finest melodic masters. In addition, his recent tag team with Germanys Nils Nuernberg saw them create an exceptional EP on Steve Bugs Poker Flat label, as well as a highlight track on the recent Bedrock - Frequencies album.\r\n\r\nSahar Z has been at the heart of Tel Aviv's electronic music culture for the past 20 years. A masterful DJ and influential proponent of the art of music programming, where each and every show is an unforgettable journey, Sahars pedigree as a collaborative kingpin has been previously established through his excellent projects with Guy Mantzur, Navar (both on Lost & Found) and Chicola (Microcastle). So, its no wonder that his new project with Stelios marks this duo as a creative force to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nThe richly imaginative Nagasaki mischievously builds anticipation in clever, intricately arranged steps, as its low-slung, rhythmically infectious groove evolves with the addition of perfectly positioned melodic motifs throughout. In contrast, crisp, crunchy beats form the basis of Osaka as it grows into a more energetic percussive workout. Layers of atmospheric excellence and teasing synth stabs give the track an emotive edge, with a swirling, deeply delicious energy. In their own distinctly different ways, both tracks form an irresistible masterclass in subtle genius.\r\n\r\nHaving been mutual admirers of each others work over the last few years, Sahar and Stelios finally established creative contact in 2017 when Stelios released his Amnesia/Saturday Sky EP on the fledgling Armadillo Records (which Sahar co-runs with Guy J).\r\n\r\n\"I think its quite common for modern DJ/Producers to get stuck in the proverbial rut and seek out collaborative experiences with other artists that can enhance or invigorate their production process and that was exactly what happened in this case. \" Stelios Vassiloudis\r\n\r\nEvolving from a starting point where Sahar shared two unfinished tracks that he (correctly) thought Stelios would be really into and able to add his unique touch the creative process. They ended up stripping things back and exchanging ideas back-and-forth over the course of a 3-month period, resulting in the masterful Nagasaki and Osaka.\r\n\r\n\"When we signed his amazing release to Armadillo, I decided to contact Stelios to share my feeling about his music and we took it from there. It was like wed known each other for years and I wish we had more down-to-earth people like him in the industry.\" Sahar Z\r\n\r\nThis exciting new duo is currently working on more tracks and exploring the possibility of doing some touring together in the near future, so their collaboration might well transcend studio productions in 2018.\r\n\r\n\"We definitely have plenty more to come in the pipeline. We live relatively near to each other, share the same time zone and have similar taste in music. Plus, Im really easy to get along with (haha), so you havent seen the last of us!\" Stelios Vassiloudis","id":144,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI110","released":"2017-12-4","title":"Nagasaki / Osaka","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":314,"release_code":"BEDDIGI110","release_id":"2166345","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Nagasaki","track_length":"8:34"},{"bpm":"120","id":315,"release_code":"BEDDIGI110","release_id":"2166345","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Osaka","track_length":"8:11"}]},{"artists":"Nick Muir;Gabriel Ananda;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/048799dd-0b36-4aca-8844-2a97fb272a98.jpg","description":"The next Bedrock release is the result of a collaborative project of the highest order from three of the scenes most respected creative mavericks - Gabriel Ananda, John Digweed and Nick Muir. Their collective concept of electronic music ventures into a vast, unexplored field of endless possibilities and is the futuristic two-part Tachyon Dream. A year in the making, the project started with John (who is a massive fan) reaching out to Gabriel to see if he would be interested in working on a project together with Nick. Gabriel already had a demo in mind that he had started and the project was soon up and running.\r\n\r\nThe adventuresome Tachyon Dream begins with a delightful hip-wiggling organic percussive groove overlaid with superbly funky keys, before evolving with abstract and uplifting melodies to introduce more driving Techno elements and soaring into a dreamlike finale. In perfect contrast John and Nicks Tachyon Dream Rework is an even more powerful, explosive beast. By upping the energy levels and introducing definitive acidic elements a sci-fi masterpiece is created, marrying the originals organic attitude with a more machine-like, technological vision from a mesmerizing, futuristic parallel universe.\r\n\r\nGabriel Ananda is continually driven forward creatively by new experiences in music, evolving and refining his very personal style ever further, to discover and explore soundscapes that evoke their own desires, dreams and emotions. He is an expressive and unique artist, who, ever since his early releases via labels such as Hörspielmusik, Karmarouge, Treibstoff, Trapez and Platzhirsch Schallplatten, has rocked dance floors around the world, pushing the boundaries of the global Techno scene from his studio in Cologne, Germany. The output from his highly respected Soulful Techno label and its accompanying podcast series are always required listening experiences.\r\n\r\nBetween them, John Digweed and Nick Muir, producers of the finest electronic dance music, have been involved in many pivotal moments in the world of club music over the years and have in many ways helped to define genres & continue to push boundaries further. Their partnership has been one of electronic music's most fruitful pairings, creating a body of work thats seen them become one of the worlds most highly regarded production duos. Joining their boundless creativity with Gabriel Ananda is yet another positive mission statement, showing that this trio of exceptional artists are not ones for resting on past laurels, but always developing themselves musically in exciting new directions. John and Nick are already working on a track (to return the favour) that Gabriel will rework and release on his own Soulful Techno label in 2018.\r\n\r\nFor those of an inquisitive nature, a Tachyon is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light.

This Producer/DJ duo are part of a global family of like-minded artists, striving to move hearts, minds, and bodies with original music that draws from a collective ancestral past, and pushes forward into the future, without limitations or borders. John Digweed has featured Dance Spirit tracks and remixes numerous times in his live sets and on his Transitions radio show (including guest mix slots for episodes 555 & 663), building towards this breath-taking debut Bedrock release.\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with Dance Spirit already will be well prepared for another sophisticated and intelligent journey, utilising a creative palette that freely expresses through a multitude of shades and colours and textures. Dance Spirits artistic ventures always stride confidently through to the mystical side of sound, rhythm, and mood. To begin, building on a super-addictive groove base, Thoughts Like Stars soars towards the heavens with a melodic beauty that is beyond compare - an exceptional journey within a journey, with a twist in the tale. In contrast, Headchange evolves into a hip-swinging groovadelic experience, morphing in texture and energy throughout. Whereas Lilac Rain switches motifs, building on playful percussive elements and acidic nuances to create a wondrously warped, spirally audio experience.\r\n\r\nChristopher Mohn and Reagan Denius revolutionized themselves into Dance Spirit four years ago, guided by a philosophy based on attaining subconscious harmony through rhythm, timbre, melody, and movement. The combination of Reagan's formal music and computer programming training, with Chriss burning passion for dance music and DJing, has created a coupling of true creative synergy. They have been steadily building a global following by selectively releasing on the likes of Supernature, Rebellion, Superfreq, Kindisch and Akbal Music.

A tune that keeps building and building momentum gradually and naturally To the point crowds singing the bassline back when you drop it. \r\n\r\nThis is the case with Gregor Treshers Goliath. Released February 2015 on Bedrock, its been smouldering ever since. The Frankfurt DJ considers it up there with A Thousand Nights and About A Good Place as one of his most successful tunes in his career so far; its distinctive hooky bass riff capturing moments and imaginations as more and more DJs exploited its unifying charm. \r\n\r\nOver two years later, Gregor and Bedrock present two precision-tailored remixes that add to the Goliath story. French techno OG Emmanuel Top, a man whose records inspired Gregor to produce in the first place, takes the lead with a 10 minute monolith that doesnt even hint at the riff for the first four minutes. Focusing on the machine funk rhythm of the original and turning it inside out, Top lets it sizzle for as long as possible before suddenly dropping the full musical scope of Goliath on us mid way. \r\n\r\nAlan Fitzpatrick, a man who doesnt need much of an introduction to fans of mordern Techno, also subverts the original in an equally remarkable way.

His excellent Frequencies collaboration with fellow countryman Patrick Chardronnet was an unmistakable highlight on John Digweeds recent namesake 3xCD compilation. Now, Martin Eyerer returns, flying solo this time with a stunning Bedrock double-header. The Lake is an immediately infectious delight, as Martin steadily adds subtle layers of percussion to create a glorious, hypnotic, hip-swinging groove, before dropping everything back and introducing striking melodic stabs. Nothing is rushed, nothing is overdone, everything is perfectly arranged - the mark of a master producer at work. The creation of yet another irresistible groove by Martin, with a distinctive playful swing based around an evolving percussive masterclass, sees his second track Rethink bounce sparsely underneath catchy synth motifs in supremely confident style.As a pioneer producer, Martin Eyerer has evolved with the times, believing that being an artist means existing in a permanent state of change, development and evolution. This is clearly evident through his various Bedrock excursions and those on his own much respected Kling Klong label (founded in 2005 with partner Rainer Weichhold). After moving from Stuttgart to Berlin in 2012 Martin (along with Jade Souaid and Tassilo Ippenberger) also opened the Riverside Studios a burgeoning hub of creativity that is home to many of the citys finest talents. As an expert mixing and mastering engineer, he also relocated his own studio here and installed his restored (and legendary) Amek M 3000 Console that was formerly owned by Pink Floyd in the 70s.

Theres an incredible Latino Detroit fusion of styles from Vancouver-based Andromo, who joins forces with much respected USA scene stalwart Chris Fortier. This Just Then marks this duo out as a future creative force to be reckoned with. The excellent production tag teams keep on coming: Austrias Philipp Straub joins forces with Swedens Charlie Thostenson; Germanys collaborative kingpin, Nils Nuernberg, teams up with Stelios Vassiloudis; Germanys multitasking maestro Martin Eyerer with fellow countryman and techno-meister Patrick Chardronnet; then theres BOg and Colognes Tim Engelhardt. Yet another bright new star on the techno horizon is Hollands Rob Hes, who joins up with the up-and-coming LAAT to raise the techno temperature on CD3 to new heights with their intense Perseverance. \r\n\r\nWhen youve got such rich and illustrious back catalogue containing unrivalled classics, to revisit at appropriate moments in time and reinterpret for a new generation, its no wonder that Frequencies reveals some very special surprises. The recently formed Rhythm Design duo provide a masterful, soaring, percussion fuelled update of the 2001 Bedrock classic Groove Is In The Air by Tijuana. Who better than Belfasts magnificent Montel to remix another classic from 2001, Phil Moonface Thompsons U Get So Give into a full-on techno beast? Saving the best until last, Pushin Too Hard (a truly legendary Bedrock track and the labels 9th release back in 2000 courtesy of Saints & Sinners), receives what can only be described as a career high point remix from the supremely talented Tel Aviv-based electronic musician and DJ, Guy Mantzur. A finale is rarely as impressive in quality as this, but since perfection from beginning to end is John Digweeds trademark, it is quite simply always what is expected from Bedrock.","id":152,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDFREQDIGI","released":"2017-7-14","title":"Bedrock -

duo of David Lopez and Carlos Cruz from La Mancha has been steadily gaining respect since they debut on Claude VonStrokes Dirtybird label in 2015. Their melody rich deeply creative sound, often combined with sultry vocals courtesy of Angela Sevilla Marquez, has graced the Kittball, Plattenbank, Exploited, and Diynamic labels, and they first came to the attention of Bedrock fans when John Digweed included Guy Js excellent dub remix of Crosses & Angels on his recent Live in Brooklyn opus.The Spanish duos esoteric, organic attitude shines through November Clouds, where a sparsely arranged, hip-swinging brooding groove is overlaid with subtle melodic flourishes and lever use of controlled feedback motifs. Otsaila continues to plough a similarly deep furrow, as the electronic overlays take the track on a more intense, glitchy, experimental trip with elongated breakdowns and twists galore. As creative reference points think the likes of LCD Soundsystem and Depeche Mode. The Lopezhouse sound is vibrant, distinctive and different, and Bedrock is always committed to introducing its audience to interesting experimentalists of the highest order.","id":153,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI102","released":"2017-7-3","title":"November Clouds / Otsaila","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":85,"release_code":"BEDDIGI102","release_id":"2053297","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"November Clouds","track_length":"7:10"},{"bpm":"121","id":86,"release_code":"BEDDIGI102","release_id":"2053297","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Otsaila","track_length":"8:47"}]},{"artists":"Ruede Hagelstein;Darren Emerson;Nick Muir;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/7737f6c8-b0ec-46cf-a5c6-7a4834d1b992.jpg","description":"Bedrock Digital is set to celebrate its milestone 100th digital single release in superb style with Tracer, the second single from Emerson, Digweed & Muir a collaborative project of the highest order from three of the scenes most respected creative mavericks, whose huge debut Fanfare (Beddigi88) had fans everywhere begging for more. Enlisting Berlins inspirational Watergate resident Ruede Hagelstein on remix duty completes the perfect package to mark yet another Bedrock landmark.\r\n\r\nFor me, personally, its such a privilege not only to be still working with John, who I consider to be one of the finest DJs ever to ply his craft, but also to work with Darren, who is one of THE most pivotal characters in UK house music and therefore the world, to whose records I remember dancing to deliriously numerous times, with everyone refusing to let the party end. And theres the clue to the success of Bedrock - we do it because we love it! Nick Muir\r\n\r\nBetween them, John Digweed and Nick Muir, producers of the finest electronic dance music, have been involved in many pivotal moments in the world of club music over the years and have in many ways helped to define genres & push the boundaries further. Their partnership has been one of electronic music's most fruitful pairings, creating a body of work thats seen them become one of the worlds most highly regarded production duos. Joining forces with Detone boss Darren Emerson, who since his pioneering days with Underworld has remained at the forefront of the electronic scene across the last three decades for good reason, is a mission statement, showing that this illustrious trio are not resting on past laurels, but always developing themselves musically in exciting new directions.\r\n\r\nRather appropriately, in its original form Tracer is an unmistakably heavyweight, pulsating, peak-time monster, loaded with menacing, fizzing, energetic, celebratory creative abandon. Meanwhile, Darren Emersons Womb Mix develops Tracer into an equally stunning, bombastic, stripped back, techno colossus, showcasing his supremely individualistic creative flair. In perfect juxtaposition to the trios versions, the dialled-back, low-slung, brooding throb of Ruede Hagelsteins mesmerizing interpretation, bristling with unrivalled electronic detail, perfectly rounds what is an exceptional creative circle. \r\n\r\nIn this day and age to not only survive as an independent label, but to flourish and constantly evolve, bringing forward and developing new and exciting talent to stand equally alongside established household names, is something that should be applauded. The global respect and love that Bedrock has steadily gained through years of releasing quality dance music that rides the waves of trends and fashions is second to none. 2017 has already seen a steady flow of exceptional Bedrock releases and there is so much more to yet to come.","id":154,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI100","released":"2017-6-19","title":"Tracer","tracks":[{"bpm":"123","id":364,"release_code":"BEDDIGI100","release_id":"2044158","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Tracer","track_length":"7:31"},{"bpm":"123","id":365,"release_code":"BEDDIGI100","release_id":"2044158","remix_title":"Ruede Hagelstein Remix","title":"Tracer","track_length":"8:51"},{"bpm":"128","id":366,"release_code":"BEDDIGI100","release_id":"2044158","remix_title":"Darren Emerson Womb Mix","title":"Tracer","track_length":"7:48"}]},{"artists":"Citizenn","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/a8dc4e96-b731-44c7-a100-8f431744cda3.jpg","description":"","id":155,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI101","released":"2017-6-5","title":"Confide EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":1297,"release_code":"BEDDIGI101","release_id":"2028679","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Confide","track_length":"7:36"},{"bpm":"123","id":1298,"release_code":"BEDDIGI101","release_id":"2028679","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"U Can't Rel8","track_length":"8:09"},{"bpm":"125","id":1299,"release_code":"BEDDIGI101","release_id":"2028679","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"To The Enlightenment","track_length":"8:28"}]},{"artists":"Jeremy Olander;Cristoph","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/fc2f2682-5e01-4d26-9580-584203851288.jpg","description":"Two artists sharing a similar sense of accelerated momentum in their careers right now, Cristoph and Jeremy Olander unite to create two beautiful sessions for the perennial Bedrock foundation.\r\n\r\nCristoph is fresh off an American tour supporting Eric Prydz and a cannon of releases on influential imprints such as Truesoul, Knee Deep In Sound, Yousefs Circus and more recently, Last Night On Earth. Jeremy Olander, with an impending North American of his own, is similarly in-demand. Much thanks to his consistent chart-topping dispatches on his own Vivrant label plus releases with the likes of Spanish power house Suara, Pryda and microCastle. With key melodic and evocative signatures, it was only a matter of time before they joined forces. And John Digweeds imprint is the perfect home for the goods.\r\n\r\nLast Dance, takes the lead on the EP and is a track that really does live up to its name. Galvanised by that all essential sense of poignancy and soft-focus feel-good theme all end-of-night finales require, its one for the dreamers as the pair set off daydream fireworks and total skin-ripples with the subtle use of a house spirited vocal. The type of track that lingers in your soul far longer than its eight minutes, its an emotional ending to a remarkable collaborative release. Lets hope they collide again in the future.\r\n\r\nNext up: the smouldering Dimensionsis at first unassuming, but weighted with a certain sense of suspense, its not until were three minutes in that we realise the trouble were in Cristoph and Jeremy have us under soul arrest and, as the track rises and rises with steam engine thrusts, its clear theyve thrown away the key.","id":156,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI99","released":"2017-5-15","title":"Last Dance EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"122","id":408,"release_code":"BEDDIGI99","release_id":"2003718","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Last Dance","track_length":"7:59"},{"bpm":"123","id":409,"release_code":"BEDDIGI99","release_id":"2003718","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Dimensions","track_length":"7:47"}]},{"artists":"Harvey McKay","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/7fce39e1-8c71-4fae-b4e6-d23806dd9810.jpg","description":"Harvey McKays tracks have long been staples in the sets of Bedrock boss John Digweed and featured on a hostour Live In compilations. 2013 saw the Scots first full release on the imprint when he teamed up with fellowtechno tormentor Carlo Lio on the excellent F-+k Jack.

This album captures such a memorable moment at what was an exceptional party in the Big Apple, where the combination of the crowds energy and clubs atmosphere fused flawlessly with the spontaneity of a timeless DJ mix to be remembered for years to come.\r\n\r\nAs is traditional at the cusp of a new year, John Digweed looked back and then forward, carefully creating yet another legendary DJ set that is both a retrospective of his favourite influential tracks from 2016 and a private preview of some exclusive future highlights for 2017. Live In Brooklyn is a showcase snapshot of cutting edge underground electronic music at its finest, that once again validates John Digweeds incomparable status as one of the worlds finest DJs.\r\n\r\nTheres a reason why John Digweed is still at the top of his game and still regarded as a true pioneer - his staunch refusal to follow trends and focused vision travel along his own distinctive path.

including EPs on Rekids, NRK, Cocoon, Flash and Gigolo; its fair to say that Artform boss and respected veteran of the scene, Jamie Anderson, has been there, seen it and got the label t-shirt. Or has he? Because today signals a first for the Berlin based Brit, as he makes his Bedrock debut with a deadly new double-header, Event Horizon / Bahia. An electronic chameleon, Jamie is as adept within the realms of deep house as he is turning out titanic techno. His brace for Bedrock explores the space between the two. Event Horizon with its dancing synth, straight kick and rasping hats is backed by the deep throbbing groove of Bahias tribal toms and stabbing keys. Darren Emerson twists his own groove on the remix of Event Horizon. Accentuating the kick, he roughens and chops the original synth to create a raw and hypnotic swing. Impressive work and a fine addition to Andersons first Bedrock outing.","id":159,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI97","released":"2017-3-27","title":"Event Horizon / Bahia","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":1030,"release_code":"BEDDIGI97","release_id":"1973575","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Event Horizon","track_length":"7:32"},{"bpm":"125","id":1031,"release_code":"BEDDIGI97","release_id":"1973575","remix_title":"Darren Emerson Remix","title":"Event Horizon","track_length":"6:40"},{"bpm":"125","id":1032,"release_code":"BEDDIGI97","release_id":"1973575","remix_title":"Original","title":"Bahia","track_length":"8:15"}]},{"artists":"Montel","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/91942830-ceff-4424-814b-46fa21b1ff16.jpg","description":"Montel returns to Bedrock with a brand new heavyweight brace in Shadows and First Light.

The EPs title track and 0901 are also highlights on the 67 track 5xCD John Digweed Live In Brooklyn, Output NYC, the forthcoming 9th edition of the much-lauded mix series.With the Moonlight EP, BOg is raising his creative bar ever upwards, each of this trio of new musical masterpieces showcasing his unique talent. The instantly addictive melodic groove and sparkling energy of Moonlight shows exactly what the young Romanian is capable of, with its hypnotic subtlety. Eternal ups the energy quotient with its powerful groove and increasingly twisted arrangement and the spirited end result is no less enthralling. Finally, rounding off the package in style comes 0901, introducing a deeper shade of darkness and warped funk into the proceedings, a combination that is sure to turn heads everywhere.Having been deeply passionate about music since childhood, BOg has risen to his current prominence through releases on the likes of Crosstown Rebels and Alex Niggemanns Soulfooled label, in addition his regular Bedrock outings. At the end of March he will also release a track on the new Secret Weapons (Innervisions) compilation album. His DJing skills have recently seen BOg perform alongside John Digweed and Eagles & Butterflies at Mexicos BPM Festival, and he also will support John at his forthcoming show in Bucharest at Kristal Glam Club. This summer BOg will grace the decks at the Electric Castle Festival (Romania) alongside Dixon, Ame, DJ Sneak, and other scene luminaries.

Quivver (aka John Graham) is one such true musical innovator, a legend in electronic music circles and renowned as being one of the scenes most essential creators since the early 1990s. The chilled Reprise versions of (the excellently titled) Mumbo Jumbo and This Was were critically acclaimed highlights on the recent Bedrock 18 album, and now, to kick-off 2017 in style, the original club versions are set for their own single release. \r\n\r\nAs you would expect from one of the worlds finest electronic producers, innovative experimentation flows freely through Quivver productions, with Mumbo Jumbo leading the way.... \r\n\r\nThe title Mumbo Jumbo came about as I was trying to come up with vocal ideas for the track and did what I usually do - sing nonsense lyrics and try to find a good melody, at which point I usually go back and write proper lyrics, but since I liked the sound of the vocal I left the random nonsense as it was - then fed some of it through Alchemy to make it sound even weirder. - Quivver \r\n\r\nThis element of open-minded electronic research has created an exceptionally original element for what is a gloriously groovy, hip-swinging, melodic gem that constantly mutates and develops from start to finish. This spirit of experimentation is continued with the deeply delicious vibes of This Was, and yet another perfect late-night Quivver delight is the end result. \r\n\r\nOn the live front, John has been keeping busy playing Quivver shows in South America, Amsterdam, Budapest, Ukraine, and Liverpool recently, and is currently readying himself to tour Japan in late January 2017. Never one to shy away from a creative curve-ball, he has also had a lot of fun playing a couple of live shows recently under his old drum & bass moniker Skanna a project he intends to revive with some new releases in the coming months. \r\n\r\nQuivvers Frisky Radio show 'Controlled Substance also continues to go from strength to strength on the 3rd Monday of every month the 21st instalment will be broadcast on 16th January at 9pm UK time (1pm USA West Coast) and is well worth checking: https://www.friskyradio.com/show/controlled_substance/ \r\n\r\nAnd finally, if youre in London, John will be performing the track Rooms, that he wrote with Sasha, as part of his two live shows at the Barbican Theatre in May.","id":163,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI93","released":"2017-2-6","title":"Mumbo Jumbo / This Was","tracks":[{"bpm":"123","id":99,"release_code":"BEDDIGI93","release_id":"1939547","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mumbo Jumbo","track_length":"6:33"},{"bpm":"120","id":100,"release_code":"BEDDIGI93","release_id":"1939547","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"This Was","track_length":"7:15"}]},{"artists":"Stelios Vassiloudis","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/b28e6c52-34c7-4e9b-a57c-ec0858d270b8.jpg","description":"Having returned from an extended musical hiatus to deliver Aprils excellent 33.3, label favourite Stelios Vassiloudis returns to double up on his former ep and close out 2016 with another fine three track selection in 66.6.

The album will be launched at a special 18th birthday party on 19th November 2016 at Ministry Of Sound, London, where John Digweed will perform a very special extended set in the main room. Expect no less than a musical master class from the Bedrock boss here as he looks to take the crowd on a journey from start to finish.\r\n\r\nBedrock 18 gives exhilarating new talent a voice through the melody infused, bottom-heavy club sound of Polish Manchester resident Sebastian Markiewicz; the deep and atmospheric aural landscapes of Brooklyn NYCs Sam Jaspersohn; Amaris melody-rich hypnotic beauty; and the distinctive emotive atmospherics of French newcomer Kontakt.\r\n\r\nInnovative experimentation flows freely through Darren Emersons foreboding beatless reprise of Fanfare, whilst Quivver presents two takes of unrivalled electronic research. The wide-ranging influences, and beautiful and unusual music of Brazilian duo Daniela Caldellas and Daniel Albinatis Digitaria project, is juxtaposed by Guy Js mind-bending 2026. All stick to the script that electronic music should have no boundaries and creativity and feelings are the only things that matter. \r\n\r\nHighly creative collaborations come from Budapests Márió Domján (a.k.a. Collective Machine) and Austrias Philipp Straub, alongside Gabriel Rocha and Juan Carlos Villalbas dynamic Tiefstone vehicle. D-Nox and Frank Beckers unfurl their distinctive sound steeped in detailed rhythms and mesmerizing harmonies, while a slice of tremendous hypnotic techno comes courtesy of Ryan Davis & Microtrauma.\r\n\r\nBedrock stalwart Phil Thompson (under his Moonface moniker) brings his unique deeply delicious grooves to the party, grooving perfectly alongside the understated beauty of Greek musical maestro Stelios Vassiloudis, and the heavy hitting techno funk of the legend that is Dave Angel; whilst Marc Romboy unleashes his deeply twisted remix of Emerson, Digweed & Muirs huge Fanfare.\r\n\r\nTheres also a bounteous array of dynamic club tunes from the likes of Geneva-based man with the midas touch Lee Van Dowski (who also adds his remix talents to Eagles & Butterflies appropriately titled and rather large Murder Was The Bass), the firing percussive funk of CJ Jeff, and the acid tinged attitude of Spains Uner on display.\r\n\r\nA distinct bonus to the exceptional and diverse talent on display throughout Bedrock 18 is the inclusion of C-Jays chilled Echoes album as a wind-down final disc. C-Jays previous artist album Backslider was also released on Bedrock (back in April 2016) gaining much critical acclaim, and here he presents his next unique artistic step further forward. \r\n\r\nIts a really, really personal album - hence the album title I think that what one has done in the past, echoes throughout ones life. Whatever you do, brings you where you are now. It might be tagged as chillout or ambient music, but actually its not 100%% that, its just me being me, making something no one else does.

Mihai Popoviciu and Markus Homm to the label with their excellent double-header Get Down / Ok Cool. With all three artists working with Martins mangement agency, its a suprise to discover that our new brace of tracks are the first from a debut and impromptu studio session. We stepped into the studio after a gig together in Markus home town says Martin. Right from the start it was an easy and flowing session, bouncing ideas off each other.Having built the bones of both, the tracks were then bounced between the trio to completion. Renowned for their organic grooves and perky percussive skills, Mihai and Markus gelled perfectly with Martins peaktime proficiency to deliver two bruising Bedrock hits. Less is most definitely more on lead track Get Down. A brooding bassline, spritely but sparse synth melody and spoken Get Down vocal work together, with a sprinkling of shimmering cymbals, to create a dark yet warm atmosphere. Dim the lights, launch the strobe, find a speaker and Get Down. On the flip Ok Cool lets us know that everythings gonna be alright by wrapping us tightly within its buzzing bassline and drifting synths. A fine Bedrock debut from our band of musical muskateers and we cant wait to have them back.","id":167,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI90","released":"2016-11-14","title":"Get Down / Ok Cool","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":79,"release_code":"BEDDIGI90","release_id":"1882944","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Get Down","track_length":"6:06"},{"bpm":"125","id":80,"release_code":"BEDDIGI90","release_id":"1882944","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Ok Cool","track_length":"7:42"}]},{"artists":"OC & Verde;Ali Ajami;3LIAS","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/f21abeb6-36ec-4095-b065-9c6a077334d0.jpg","description":"What better time for an enchanting, smile-inducing end of summer treat from John Digweeds Bedrock label?

Once heard, this inspirational track, created by Kris Needs and Wonder in their Secret Knowledge guise, can most certainly never be forgotten, and the rush of excitement and adulation that the revived classic received set the wheels in motion for John Digweed and Nick Muir to remix the track for a summer 2016 full single release on Bedrock, along with two of the re-mastered original versions.Initiating proceedings with their trademark, super-solid percussive backbone, John Digweed and Nick Muir have had untold fun re-arranging, twisting and tweaking a plethora of spellbinding parts from the original to create their own distinctive updated vision of the original classic. Wonders gloriously breathy, seductive vocal, married with a selection of irresistibly hypnotic Moroder-esque hooks is a perfect combination for the duo to create one of the most stunningly distinctive reworks of 2016.To anyone who was clubbing back in the early 90s that Whoo. from the Original Mix still sends shivers down the spine today. Add to the equation a thunderstorm; bluesy finger snaps; Wonders unbelievably erotic vocals; a body pummelling kick drum; Kris Needs homage to the mighty Giorgio Moroder via a merciless, throbbing groove; top it all off subtle, euphoric pads, and what you have is the perfect recipe that led to the creation of one of the best, ecstatic electronic club tracks from an era when anything was possible and genre restrictive rules were yet to be written. Now, re-mastered for a summer 2016 release on Bedrock, a new generation of clubbers can discover the delights of Secret Knowledge and their Sugar Daddy. The respectful package is completed with the re-mastered original Out Of Our Brains on The 5.15 Mix (created with the involvement of David Holmes after he witnessed the unbelievable emotional crowd reaction when Andrew Weatherall dropped the original mix at a club in Brighton).

Nothing is rushed, the pace is perfect, the arrangement sublime. The complex interplay of percussive parts becomes an integral melodic element, underpinned with the rising swell of deep bass pads, steadily building towards a euphoric breakdown before re-launching into a heavenly final movement of blissful magnificence. It is no wonder that Lunchtime is such a master-class of musical brilliance, because H.O.S.H. is a DJ who values the art of mixing records and sequencing journeys - preferably long ones - over anything else. Anyone who has been witness to his DJ sets played during his gigs on every continent over the last few years would be unlikely to disagree. His lengthy sessions behind the decks have afforded him an exceptional, invaluable insight into exactly what works best on the worlds finest dancefloors.\"When it comes to producing, making music for me is like cooking - the meal / track gets better the more love you put in.\" H.O.S.H.Since 2006, H.O.S.H. has been an integral cog in the Diynamic wheel (alongside sometime flatmate and label boss Solomun and frequent collaborator Stimming) and, as a result, has helped steer house music into highly adventurous, uncharted waters.

The end result is a super-fuelled, energetic, euphoric masterclass of a track.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the speedy, hissing, bounce of “Venom” is also an instant winning formula, with layered, looping melodic hooks building all the track’s elements into a hip-swinging, funked-up monster.

This sparkling gem of a track pushed all the right buttons with a euphoric attitude that only comes from years of experience of rocking the best dancefloors around the world week in week out, and now the label is set to take the story to the next level with 3 diverse, exciting new remixes.\r\n\r\nThe enigmatic Rich Lane from Newcastle Under Lyme (who also records under aliases such as Original Disco Thing and Chug Norris) has been gaining plaudits for his musical creations that loosely fall into the realms of what are variously tagged Slo-Mo, Chug, Nu-Disco and even NEW New Beat. By channelling the sounds and feel of classic House, Techno, New Beat etc. and mellowing the groove towards a slower mid-tempo ride, whilst adding a sprinkling Post Punk, Funk and Synth Pop, Rich Lane is a masterful producer who draws together so many disparate elements that seem to unite a particular type of music lover. Here, through his love of classic analogue sounds, he has created a truly original take on Sad Robot.\r\n\r\nGerman duo, Christian \"D-Nox\" Wedekind and Frank Beckers, have become firm favourites worldwide over the past 10 years with a perfect fusion of studio expertise and an impeccable dancefloor touch Their creative chemistry has become an unfailing source of massive grooves and their exceptional remix of Sad Robot sees them firmly at the forefront of the current phase of musical evolution, drawing from the best elements of a variety of musical genres, to create a mesmerizing new future.\r\n\r\nHailing from the current hotbed of exciting musical evolution, Argentinas Alejo Gonzalez (renowned for his show on Radio 90.3FM Delta) has joined forces with fellow DJ and producer Max Blade to create a beautifully melancholic interpretation of Sad Robot, a perfect, understated finale for this remix package. The undoubted talent of this young duo marks them out as being ones to watch for the future, for sure.","id":179,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI79","released":"2016-5-2","title":"Sad Robot Remixes","tracks":[{"bpm":"110","id":1197,"release_code":"BEDDIGI79","release_id":"1752598","remix_title":"Rich Lane Remix","title":"Sad Robot","track_length":"7:38"},{"bpm":"120","id":1198,"release_code":"BEDDIGI79","release_id":"1752598","remix_title":"D-Nox & Beckers Remix","title":"Sad Robot","track_length":"8:23"},{"bpm":"120","id":1199,"release_code":"BEDDIGI79","release_id":"1752598","remix_title":"Alejo Gonzalez & Max Blade Remix","title":"Sad Robot","track_length":"7:32"}]},{"artists":"Stelios Vassiloudis","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c57e3bc9-ef93-4c39-8a07-472952382a15.jpg","description":"Stelios Vassiloudis makes a welcome return to Bedrock with an excellent 3 track Ep aptly named 33.3.

It was recorded live on October 25th, 2015, at Stereo, a club known for its afterhours parties and marathon sets. (Digweed actually played for 11 hours that night.) In among the 80 plus featured tracks, there are efforts from Sei A, Damian Lazarus & The Ancient Moons, Agoria and Adam Beyer, as well as three Recondite cuts. \r\n\r\n\"It's hard to pinpoint one particular highlight as I was loving every part of the night with the energy from the build-up and the reaction I was getting from the floor,\" he says. \"Playing Eagles & Butterflies' rework of DK8's 'Murder Was The Bass' was a real moment as the place exploded. It's really important on nights like this that you pace yourself so you don't give the crowd everything too early; you always want them to keep wanting more. I remember looking at my watch around 9 AM and thinking I have not really started banging it yet, but the place was going nuts and over the next four hours the energy in the room hit another level. It's a real pleasure to play on that soundsystem for that long.\"","id":184,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDMONTCD","released":"2016-2-26","title":"John Digweed - Live In

important things in my life, and this message I want to spread through my songs. Love not only to people but to all kinds of beings and things. - DasoDaso Franke was born in Poona (India) and at the age of five was using the dance floor of his fathers disco as a playground, growing up with the music of Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix and radio pop. Now, living in Berlin, this multi-talented music producer, live act and party machine, is one of the most exciting artists to emerge in recent times on the never-ending rollercoaster ride that is the modern electronic music circus. He is now set to make his emphatic debut on John Digweeds Bedrock Records with two stunning creations.Bold and Bold with its sensuously seductive motifs, deeply hypnotic groove backbone, all hallmarked with Dasos defining elegance and style, is perfectly suited to Bedrocks forward-thinking creative ethos. In the same way, the energetic, yet subtle throb of Ashvem Beach mixes acidic undertones with ethereal beauty into a stunningly effective concoction that is both refreshing and mesmerizing.If you havent had the chance to witness Dasos live performances, they come highly recommended. From emotional house, that can abruptly and unexpectedly morph into rave hymns and powerful techno, he controls the crowd by creating ecstatic moments through perfectly timed changes of style. Daso is a rare talent, an extraordinary artist and performer, whose Bedrock debut will surely be lighting up dancefloors everywhere for many moons to come.","id":188,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI72","released":"2015-11-23","title":"Daso Bold & Bold / Ashvem Beach","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":286,"release_code":"BEDDIGI72","release_id":"1652002","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Bold & Bold","track_length":"8:33"},{"bpm":"125","id":287,"release_code":"BEDDIGI72","release_id":"1652002","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Ashvem Beach","track_length":"7:33"}]},{"artists":"Dave Angel","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/4880b4d7-fa93-4813-963c-c0316a9383fb.jpg","description":"Referencing one of the great fights of Greek mythology, Dave Angels two new titanic Techno tracks for John Digweeds Bedrock duel for dominance, in what is undoubtedly a supreme return to the label from the Godfather of the UKs Techno scene. Set for release in the time whilst Scorpio is the current and reputedly the most powerful sign of the zodiac, it looks like the stars are aligned to perfection.\r\n\r\nScorpion has already featured exclusively in Eats Everythings BBCR1 Essential Mix, recorded live at T In The Park, and is set to fly. Built around a sophisticated, multi-layered, hip-swinging groove, its ever-evolving, hypnotic, melodic bounce builds magically through a series of stunning breakdown crescendos into a totally mesmerising and unforgettable masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe subtly powerful Orion takes a deeper, but no less impressive melodic route to total groove engagement. Interspersing proceedings with teasing vocal snippets and subtle euphoric synth swells proves to be another a winning formula. Both tracks demonstrate exactly why Dave remains such a driving force today, having evolved and matured stylistically over the years, since his early heart-stopping techno outings more than 2 decades ago now.\r\n\r\nThe son of a jazz musician, Dave Angels first musical instrument (appropriately) was a drum at age of eight, so its no surprise that he developed an ear for a good groove. Since entering the consciousness of the techno community in 1990, he has pretty much remained there ever since. Although hes London born and bred, he has been making records like he's from Detroit with a distinctive twist of funk and jazz for years. Dave Angel is one of the scenes true characters, giving off an aura of positivity like no other, a kind of warmth that you cannot fail to feel through his exceptional, uplifting music.

A thinking mans DJ and producer, he has played all over the world, has been a regular at Sankeys Ibiza this summer and is as skilled at crafting albums as he is club-owning 12s. \r\n\r\nUp first, Belen is an epic seven minute workout that grows in stature as it unfolds.

It is a smooth and serene track that cannot fail to entrance whole dance floors as it rumbles on, right on the cusp between house and techno. \r\n\r\nThen comes Afredo, a more percussive work out but still one resplendent with rich chords and airy pads. Big, loose fingered piano chords dominate this one as they jangling above the mildly euphoric drum line and gallivanting kicks. \r\n\r\nEpic and fulsome, and impossible to ignore, this is a pair of tracks that fit perfectly with the Bedrock cannon at the same time as bringing something fresh to the label.","id":195,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI67","released":"2015-8-31","title":"Argy - Belen / Alfredo","tracks":[{"bpm":"127","id":155,"release_code":"BEDDIGI67","release_id":"1592334","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Belen","track_length":"7:34"},{"bpm":"128","id":156,"release_code":"BEDDIGI67","release_id":"1592334","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Alfredo","track_length":"8:12"}]},{"artists":"BOg;Jonas Saalbach","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c193ded0-48b8-4a55-baae-361a253b27cb.jpg","description":"","id":196,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI66","released":"2015-8-10","title":"Drawing Board","tracks":[{"bpm":"119","id":418,"release_code":"BEDDIGI66","release_id":"1580400","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Drawing Board","track_length":"8:39"},{"bpm":"122","id":419,"release_code":"BEDDIGI66","release_id":"1580400","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Abrial","track_length":"5:58"},{"bpm":"121","id":420,"release_code":"BEDDIGI66","release_id":"1580400","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Amarna","track_length":"7:30"},{"bpm":"121","id":421,"release_code":"BEDDIGI66","release_id":"1580400","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Indie Rubels","track_length":"7:59"},{"bpm":"123","id":422,"release_code":"BEDDIGI66","release_id":"1580400","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Prince","track_length":"8:07"}]},{"artists":"Quivver","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c7783d94-a5af-4280-b56a-0e8afd6f488c.jpg","description":"John Digweeds Bedrock label is focused on releasing exceptional, forward-thinking electronic music, constantly working with some of the worlds finest artists, whose musical palettes are intensely inspired and musically diverse. Quivver (aka John Graham) is one such true musical innovator, renowned as being one of the scenes most essential creators since the early 1990s. Here, he once again returns to Bedrock with his Takin Over EP, showcasing three stunning new creations. \r\n\r\nWith Takin Over I wanted to do something for the summer with a slightly old school flavour. Its the most melodic track Ive written in a while and I specifically had Ibizas beaches in mind in the studio. I wanted it to be a track that would sound good pre-club, post-club and in a club so the chord stabs are soft and the acid riffs sparse and echoed so it has a laid back feel and I layered some ambient noise in the background so it sounds a bit like it was recorded live at some outdoor beach club somewhere Quivver\r\n\r\nThe extraordinarily evocative title track is a truly beautiful musical master-class, with a timeless quality that immediately sets this EP apart from so much of todays disposable mass music production line. Lose Your Way ups the energy levels and darkness factor, its filmic qualities taking things into a very different audio-visual realm. In yet more textural contrast, Time Goes By displays a deeply euphoric attitude that is uplifting, intelligent and magical. There can be no doubt that Quivver remains one of the worlds standout electronic artists in 2015.\r\n\r\nJohn Graham (Quivver) started his production career in the early 1990s, and has been a household name within the electronic music scene ever since, operating under various monikers, each representing a different shade of his incredibly broad, eclectic production palette. Not only a worldwide renowned DJ/Producer, as a vocalist, John has collaborated and written electrifying songs for the likes of Hybrid, Planet Funk and also Darren Emersons The Low Highs. His new rock/electronic album \"Cold Sun\" has also just been released. \r\n\r\nIf you havent discovered the beautiful, chilled Takin Over Reprise on the 8am disc of the new John Digweeds Underground Sound of Ibiza Series 2 (Bedrock) album, it also comes highly recommended.","id":197,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI65","released":"2015-7-27","title":"Takin' Over EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":145,"release_code":"BEDDIGI65","release_id":"1572178","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Takin Over","track_length":"7:44"},{"bpm":"122","id":146,"release_code":"BEDDIGI65","release_id":"1572178","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Lose Your Way","track_length":"6:19"},{"bpm":"122","id":147,"release_code":"BEDDIGI65","release_id":"1572178","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Time Go By","track_length":"7:06"}]},{"artists":"Guy J;Confute;Various Artists;Omid 16B;Leo Leal;Cosmic Cowboys;G-Mohris;Charlie May;R.E.C.

With the release date set for June 22 2015, Live in South Beach Bedrock at the Treehouse is now available for pre-order, exclusively from the Bedrock Records official store. Taken from live recordings of a mammoth 5 +hour set at the fabled Treehouse in Miami, the mix is aptly extended across 3 CDs and 41 tracks, enthralling the listener at every turn. With each section invoking a new tone, Digweed continues to showcase cutting edge underground electronic music at its very best, and validates his incomparable status as one of the worlds finest DJs. Digweeds latest opus takes the listener on a sonic journey through a perfectly crafted soundscape, blending multiple genres with ease. Featuring productions from seasoned veterans such as Nicole Moudaber, Robert Babicz and Alan Fitzpatrick, intertwined with those of up-and-coming producers such as Locked Groove, Gardens of God and Luna Semara, Digweed continues to express his love for fresh and contemporary forward-thinking electronic music. This love is translated into a collection of tracks that demonstrate an unmitigated understanding of underground dance music, a selection that proves Digweed as significant a DJ as ever. Starting with the dark brooding sounds of BOSOs Gardens of God, and PHMs percussion heavy remix of Olaf Stutts experimental Spirograph, CD1 then glides into an exposition of vocal-laden grooves. Progressing into CD2, an ethereal outset culminates in Locked Grooves spacious techno adaption of Jules ampersand Moss Head Juice, setting the driving tone for the remainder of the CD. The final CD sees Digweed effortlessly combining Drumcode techno with Bedrocks own brand, finishing with an underrated Kompakt classic that is sure to reach new ears.","id":199,"labels":"Bedrock

is my life!\" Marc RomboyIn its quest to release exceptional, forward-thinking electronic music, John Digweeds Bedrock label constantly joins forces with some of the worlds finest artists. One name missing, until now, has been Düsseldorfs world-renowned DJ/Producer, Marc Romboy, whose deep, engaging house and techno sounds mark him out as a true maverick.Label debuts dont come bigger than this, Counting Comets Part 1 is an electronic opus that channels the spirit of early original electronic innovators (such as Kraftwerk) and creates a truly futuristic vision: hypnotic, cinematic, a fantastical journey towards utter dancefloor delirium and beyond. The spiritual beauty and flowing energy of Osiris is no less wondrous, its subtle melancholic euphoria and deeply delicious groove will make it a standout selection anywhere.\"I love to DJ all over the globe, because I like the way that everybody understands and lives the same language, the universal language of techno or house music. \" Marc RomboyElectronic music with a certain piece of soul - reminiscent of old school Chicago/Detroit dance floor insanity - is Marc Romboys true passion. He has been a distinctive presence in the house/techno scene for two decades, launching two ground-breaking labels, Le Petit Prince (1994) and Systematic (2004), and presenting his weekly radio show \"Systematic Sessions\" (since 2009), never tiring of coming up with fresh and innovative ideas to push the limits of electronic sounds. Marc Romboys exceptional Bedrock debut is one to treasure for a long time to come.Also, listen out for a stunning downtempo version of Counting Comets Part 2 coming in July on Bedrocks Underground Sound Of Ibiza 2 3xCD compilation album.","id":200,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI64","released":"2015-6-15","title":"Counting Comets Part 1 / Osiris","tracks":[{"bpm":"118","id":731,"release_code":"BEDDIGI64","release_id":"1543340","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Counting Comets Part 1","track_length":"10:36"},{"bpm":"120","id":732,"release_code":"BEDDIGI64","release_id":"1543340","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Osiris","track_length":"7:15"}]},{"artists":"Pig&Dan","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c3d5d971-4013-48c4-9b03-8dbea143b1e0.jpg","description":"If youre talking about exciting underground producers, two of the first names out of anyones hat should always be Igor Tchkotoua and Dan Duncan (aka Pig&Dan), whose distinctive mixture of influences has given them a sound that is both innovative and easily recognizable. Pig&Dan have been flying high over the past months with a series of exceptional releases, so you can be sure that their return to John Digweeds Bedrock label is very special indeed. The 4Play EP opens with the fizzing slow-build title track that grooves and ebbs and flows with supreme creative confidence, teasing and toying in typical Pig&Dan style throughout. Return To Mono, with its deep, deep bass intro, builds some dark, twisted tension with a percussive edge into the equation. Finally, Sofia adds more melody from Pig&Dans broad artistic palette, creating a pulsating, hypnotic gem to round off this EP in style.If you are familiar with Pig&Dans work, youll know they're always looking to push the envelope with genre-bending music and a devotion to creating something special that gets right under the skin. Their 4Play EP for Bedrock is another perfect example of their collective genius.It would be hard to find another duo whose creative juices are flowing so freely right now. Make sure you check their recent, supremely diverse, experimentally brilliant album (Destination Unknown) on Bedrock, showcasing sides of Pig&Dans musical diversity that you may never have experienced before. Along with their continuing flow of monster releases on their own Elevate label, this special meeting of minds is being cherished and developed to ever-greater heights as the years tick by, leaving the future of music in very safe hands indeed.","id":201,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI63","released":"2015-6-1","title":"4 Play EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"124","id":455,"release_code":"BEDDIGI63","release_id":"1536940","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"4 Play","track_length":"6:05"},{"bpm":"120","id":456,"release_code":"BEDDIGI63","release_id":"1536940","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Return To Mono","track_length":"7:28"},{"bpm":"124","id":457,"release_code":"BEDDIGI63","release_id":"1536940","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Sofia","track_length":"8:07"}]},{"artists":"Robert Babicz","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c7acbedf-ab2d-4cbb-930a-b9b905cad4ac.jpg","description":"Robert Babicz is a man on a mission, the Cologne based producer stands tall as one of only a handful of distinctive artists who are bold enough to breathe life into their productions with true emotion. His creations display a level of honesty and soul that sets them apart from so much of todays here-today-gone-tomorrow disposable music - the mark of a true musical innovator. Here, he returns to Bedrock and reveals his talent and skill as one of Europe's most essential techno producers, with two stunning tracks for the summer season.The wonderfully deep, wobbly throb of Fading Hearts is a masterclass in dub-inflected hip-swinging goodness. Overlaid with gorgeous, subtle melodic flourishes, its angelic beauty is a true wonder to behold. Meanwhile, Density Disrupted turns up the darkness factor, shifts proceedings up a gear and gets suitably twisted in supreme style, showing another side to Babiczs seemingly infinite creative palette.Robert Babicz moved to Germany from his native Poland in 1980 and began making dance music in the early 1990s, when acid house was at its peak of popularity. His career has thus already spanned more than two decades and it is evidently clear from the music that he creates, that he has devoted his life to his craft. A much-respected connoisseur of sound design and production, his services as a mastering engineer are in demand all over the world. He is also well known as an exciting live performer, utilizing a host of synths and live equipment to enhance the improvisation in every set he plays. But Babicz's art is comprised of more than just his music. He films everything, later editing the images together as a visual accompaniment to his audio. His short films capture the emotions, colours and feel of his trips and, in turn, these then also have an effect on his music, colouring his emotive, unique take on electronica with a very human feel. If you like what you hear and want to dig a little deeper into the Bedrock back catalogue to check out Robert Babiczs previous adventures on the label, you could start with 2010s Pink Trees, his remix of Pete Hellers Nu Acid, the stupendous Welcome To The 90s from Bedrock 12, Eastside from Bedrock 14, Rabbit Clouds from the Underground Sound Of Miami Series 3, and his huge Rave Angel.Keep it Babiczstyle!","id":202,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI62","released":"2015-5-18","title":"Fading Hearts / Density Disrupted","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":1377,"release_code":"BEDDIGI62","release_id":"1527566","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Fading Hearts","track_length":"9:07"},{"bpm":"120","id":1378,"release_code":"BEDDIGI62","release_id":"1527566","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Density Disrupted","track_length":"8:49"}]},{"artists":"Dave Angel","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/00a3aa90-1dfb-45c3-ad45-ad689b22bca0.jpg","description":"Dave Angel - regarded by many as the Godfather of the UKs Techno scene, returns to Bedrock with a stunning new single.\r\n\r\nDave is becoming a regular highlight on the label: his remix of Marco Baileys Rubber Band in 2011 was hailed as a pure master-class in techno genius, Harlequin was a 2013 highlight, Keep It lit up the Underground Sound of Miami, and his Voodoo EP made 2014 an even better year for Techno music. Now, having recently caused a commotion on Crosstown Rebels, he is set to amaze on Bedrock once more.\r\n\r\nThe powerful, bubbling throb of Progress, overlaid with the snap and hiss of perfect percussive hits, interspersed with teasing vocal snippets and subtle euphoric synth swells, is a winning formula. Meanwhile, Stand Strong oozes a powerful, darker energy, with a breakdown of epic proportions. Both tracks demonstrate exactly why Dave remains such a driving force today, having evolved and matured stylistically over the years, since his early heart-stopping techno outings more than 2 decades ago now.\r\n\r\nThe son of a jazz musician, Dave Angels first musical instrument (appropriately) was a drum at age of eight, so its no surprise that he developed an ear for a good groove. Since entering the consciousness of the techno community in 1990, he has pretty much remained there ever since. Although hes London born and bred, he has been making records like he's from Detroit with a distinctive twist of funk and jazz for years. Dave Angel is one of the scenes true characters, giving off an aura of positivity like no other, a kind of warmth that you cannot fail to feel through his exceptional, uplifting music.

Not a chance. January saw the remixed version of the album hit the stores and this was backed within a few weeks by 'Taurus', Gregor's enticing collaboration with Petar Dundov. The summer saw him remix the Chymera classic 'Shadowdancer' and he closed 2014 with the superb 'Midas / Disturber' double-header. \r\n\r\nSomewhat of a musical chameleon, Tresher is as at home creating deeper shades of house for the likes of Moon Harbour and Ovum as he is techno rhythms for Music Man, Cocoon and Systematic. \r\n\r\nWith label boss Digweed a huge fan, Bedrock is yet another perfect fit for the German and he opens his account with the mighty, melodic and Kraken'esque 'Goliath' and the razor-sharp lightning bolt that is 'Stormblade'.","id":207,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI59","released":"2015-1-26","title":"Goliath / Stormblade","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":518,"release_code":"BEDDIGI59","release_id":"1453342","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Goliath","track_length":"7:26"},{"bpm":"126","id":519,"release_code":"BEDDIGI59","release_id":"1453342","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Stormblade","track_length":"6:42"}]},{"artists":"Atapy;BOg","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/30d06877-44d7-4228-a9a9-e95b9ccee3d9.jpg","description":"Bedrock launches into 2015 with a highly creative double-header from two respected artists from the revolution that is currently happening in the Romanian electronic scene Atapy & BOg. Whether it's the deeply delicious uplifting melodies and dramatic strings of Strung, or the more intense melancholic journey of Despair, there can be no denying that this duo are ones to watch this year. Their distinctive collaborative style and attention to detail marks them out as having unique creative talent. \r\n\r\nFor Romanias Arpi Takacs (aka Atapy), addiction to electronic music started early, first as a regular freak in club corners and then behind the decks, developing his DJ skills. Since 2010, his career has been firmly on the rise with likes of M.A.N.D.Y., Ritchie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier, Dubfire, Tom Budden, Djuma Soundsystem and many more, championing his highly desirous productions. Its all about quality and not quantity for Atapy, with previous key releases on his own Cimelde label and Get Physical, alongside his collaborations with (amongst others): Noir, Digitaria and Cari Golden; and reworking The XX and the legendary Knight Rider theme, here is an artist with both style and passion.\r\n\r\nBOg is a Romanian electronic music composer and DJ, based in Paris. Also deeply passionate about music since childhood, he has risen to his current prominence through releases on Crosstown Rebels, Fumakilla, Akbal Music, and (not forgetting) a recent superb remix of Gridlock by none other than John Digweed & Nick Muir on Bedrock.

While science fiction and electronic music have intertwined at numerous points since the emergence of the genre from Jeff Mills to Global Communication and beyond - together with bestselling author, John Twelve Hawks, Digweed & Muir have taken the relationship into new territory and the album, The Traveler, is the result of this symbiotic connection.\r\n\r\nHawks wrote his trilogy of The Traveler novels while listening to Digweeds mix albums and weekly radio show, Transitions. After contacting the UK DJ and producer and an exchange that crossed several years (for reasons John outlines below), they agreed to work together to bring Hawks works to life via a collaborative album, and with Hawks as the narrator. The end result saw Hawks travel to the UK in secret, (he lives off the grid, hiding behind a secret identity due to his beliefs regarding the intrusiveness of the modern state and digital society themes that are central to his work) and recorded his spoken word contributions to accompany an electronic music soundtrack created by Digweed and Muir. The meeting took place in the middle of nowhere, Hawks then disappeared back to whence he came, and the three have had limited contact since.\r\n\r\nThe Traveler is a unique and fascinating album, providing a listening experience that exists far beyond the dancefloor though the track 3B3 will be released as a single including a picture disk format. The music draws the listener deep into the world of the The Traveler, brought further to life by Hawks spoken word passages taken directly from the novel. The accompanying physical release features extensive sleevenotes and artwork, making it an extremely collectable item for fans and beyond.\r\n\r\nJOHN DIGWEED SAID:It all started when a copy of the book The Traveler was sent to me from John Twelve Hawks publishers with a letter explaining that John had been listening to my Transitions Radio show while writing the book and wanted me to have a copy as a thank you. Due to my busy schedule it wasnt until the following year when I was on holiday that I finally got a chance to read the book. From the very first page I was hooked and couldn't put it down until it was finished. \r\n\r\nDigweed continues:I left a little thank you message in Jan 2009 thanking John through his website and didnt think any more about it. Fast forward to Oct 2010 when, in the course clearing out my junk emails, I came across a reply from John Hawks himself - which I had completely missed. You can imagine how I felt! I responded straight away and this is an extract from the reply I received: I just wanted to say that I've followed your career over the years and have always wondered if we could create a project together. Contacting you was not a casual action. I know what you've done. In fact, while I'm writing this, I'm listening to GU 006: Sydney. I played what I call the \"dark\" CD -- CD 1 -- hundreds of times while I was writing book two of the trilogy, The Dark River. I'm bringing it up because -- like any good DJ -- you were able to establish a building momentum, a mood and a climax. This is what any dramatic form does: a film, novel or play.\r\n\r\nSo I thought, why not mix genres? A telephone conversation was arranged with John on his satellite phone, conducted via his voice scrambler that he uses on all his telephone conversations. We agreed that Nick and myself would attempt a project consisting of music based on passages from the book and after some initial discussions, it was decided that John Twelve Hawks would be the narrator. This posed a problem however, as John maintains strict secrecy about his identity in order that he may express his ideas about modern day threats to personal liberty more freely. At first, a meeting with him seemed out of the question. So we tried recording his voice down the phone through his voice changing software, but it quickly became obvious that we would need to record him directly in order to ensure his narrated contributions were clear and fully audible.\r\n\r\nWe put this to John and he graciously agreed. We arranged a meeting with him, 'off the grid' as he puts it, in the middle of nowhere. He duly arrived at the appointed time, obviously we can't say anything about this meeting, what he looked like or how he was as a person as this would betray his trust; however, all went well and we recorded his narrated passages which he delivered perfectly like the consummate professional he is. And then, after a few brief pleasantries, he was gone as quickly as he had arrived. We havent seen him since, nor spoken to him save for a few communications relayed on email from his protected account.\r\n\r\nHis contributions have been treated and changed with software in a variety of different ways on the album and the original recordings of his voice have been deleted to further protect his identity. These measures may seem drastic but this is how he wishes to conduct his career as an author in relation to the subject matter he deals with and we completely respect that. He is a perfect example of how it is possible to operate within an underground culture and we are privileged and delighted to bring a musical perspective to his ideas.","id":213,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","released":"2014-10-6","title":"The Traveler","tracks":[{"bpm":"118","id":892,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"First Line","track_length":"4:57"},{"bpm":"101","id":893,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Live Off The Grid","track_length":"7:12"},{"bpm":"110","id":894,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Am I Awake","track_length":"4:36"},{"bpm":"105","id":895,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Capoiera","track_length":"6:56"},{"bpm":"152","id":896,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Stay In The Present","track_length":"2:31"},{"bpm":"105","id":897,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Traveler","track_length":"4:57"},{"bpm":"90","id":898,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Truth","track_length":"4:51"},{"bpm":"91","id":899,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Battle","track_length":"4:48"},{"bpm":"89","id":900,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Find The Way","track_length":"4:03"},{"bpm":"86","id":901,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Damned By The Flesh","track_length":"5:19"},{"bpm":"96","id":902,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"3B3","track_length":"5:49"},{"bpm":"92","id":903,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"We Are All Connected","track_length":"5:23"},{"bpm":"123","id":904,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Last Line","track_length":"2:44"},{"bpm":"118","id":905,"release_code":"BEDTRAV01CD","release_id":"1385645","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Traveler - Continuous Album Mix","track_length":"1:00:16"}]},{"artists":"Zombies In Miami;Jemmy;Leza Boyland","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/7a60d38b-5d8d-44e8-8186-b3bfba946c39.jpg","description":"","id":214,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI54","released":"2014-9-29","title":"Breathe In","tracks":[{"bpm":"122","id":866,"release_code":"BEDDIGI54","release_id":"1378515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Breathe In","track_length":"6:42"},{"bpm":"122","id":867,"release_code":"BEDDIGI54","release_id":"1378515","remix_title":"Zombies In Miami Remix","title":"Breathe In","track_length":"9:17"}]},{"artists":"Fairmont;Nick Muir;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/e83e42d1-29f9-4874-8ac3-1315a624e7b3.jpg","description":"","id":215,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDVSRMX03","released":"2014-9-22","title":"Gigawave - Fairmont Remix","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":379,"release_code":"BEDVSRMX03","release_id":"1378505","remix_title":"Fairmont Remix","title":"Gigawave","track_length":"6:31"}]},{"artists":"Jimmy Van M;Sabb;Henry Saiz;BOg;Javi Row;Max Demand;Nick Muir;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/132537dd-465f-4360-80a2-dc10f5d52eb4.jpg","description":"A gem from the vaults reworked superbly by two of the hottest names in clubland, Jimmy Van M and Sabb.\r\n\r\nTwo mixes to choose from, the 3AM Remix is a melodic chunky gem that beautifully builds as warm pads raise the temperature and tease with with melodics from the original and some clever FX cutting up, making this a serious dance floor moment.

The album entitled Destination Unknown holds no boundaries, fusing together genres and styles far beyond electronic musics own (increasingly broad) spectrum. \r\n\r\nReleased on John Digweeds Bedrock label, Destination Unknown breaks out from Pig&Dans roots and pushes their personal envelope of influences to a wider audience who may not have been exposed to downtempo, funk and the (almost) anything goes philosophy of Balearic music.\r\n\r\nOne of the main instigators of this trip Malcolm Molly Duncan, father of Dan and founder of the legendary soul group, The Average White band, was a massive part of encouraging the evolution of this project.\r\n\r\nOther members of the musical family, California-born singer/lyricist, Glen Anthony Henry AKA Ageel, funk guitar guru, Tim Cansfield, cultural hip hop master, Jamie Reixach AKA Giacomo Legendary Reggae vocalist Paul De Swardt, Tech house legend & Soul Camp founder, Werner Niedermeier, Spanish jazz genius, Jaime Rosello aka Ruspei, Grammy winning soundtrack guitarist Joan Bibiloni \r\n\r\nAfter a chance meeting on a flight in 1999, Pig&Dan joined forces to combine their interest in music production. Thus began a truly prolific production schedule with 18 releases in the first year, establishing their reputation as producers of pulsating electronic music. In 2003, they launched their first label Submission and a sound that would attract Cocoon Recordings, After releasing Oh Yeah they followed up 8 more releases on the seminal Frankfurt imprint, including their own artist album, Imagine. \r\n\r\nAfter this they continued to build their ever increasing profile by collaborating with some of the industries greats such as UNDERWORLD and Monika Kruse plus Remixing for Giants such as Deadmau5 and Paul Kalkbrenner to name a few.\r\n\r\nAlmost 11 years down the line and Pig&Dan have been blessing the decks of many of the biggest events and festivals worldwide. Recently the duo launched a new digital and vinyl imprint titled ELEVATE. The labels title sums up their sound and devotion to dynamic music in just one word.\r\n\r\nBedrock Records have recently just celebrated their fifteenth anniversary and the label is going from strength to strength, releasing quality single releases and artist albums, plus the hugely successful Live In compilation series from John Digweed. With releases crossing over many genres, Bedrock's consistency and John Digweed's prolific touring continues to attract a newer audience to the label.","id":218,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDEST01CD","released":"2014-9-1","title":"Pig&Dan - Destination Unknown","tracks":[{"bpm":"141","id":1826,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"I Feel Love","track_length":"7:09"},{"bpm":"95","id":1827,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Urban Armchair","track_length":"6:29"},{"bpm":"72","id":1828,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Dub It In","track_length":"5:15"},{"bpm":"107","id":1829,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Friday Freaks","track_length":"5:07"},{"bpm":"131","id":1830,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Freefall","track_length":"7:02"},{"bpm":"95","id":1831,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"China Doll","track_length":"7:42"},{"bpm":"129","id":1832,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Unplugged","track_length":"7:00"},{"bpm":"152","id":1833,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Too Much Space","track_length":"5:13"},{"bpm":"100","id":1834,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Charas","track_length":"4:33"},{"bpm":"76","id":1835,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Silk","track_length":"7:32"},{"bpm":"158","id":1836,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Windchime","track_length":"6:57"},{"bpm":"86","id":1837,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"We're Cooking Hard Now","track_length":"4:16"},{"bpm":"115","id":1838,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"OneTwoSeven","track_length":"4:55"},{"bpm":"150","id":1839,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Es La Vida","track_length":"3:20"},{"bpm":"126","id":1840,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Magic Wake Up Call","track_length":"5:02"},{"bpm":"90","id":1841,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Tokyo Twilight","track_length":"4:09"},{"bpm":"88","id":1842,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Rimshot Shuffle","track_length":"6:40"},{"bpm":"122","id":1843,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Positive Vibrations","track_length":"4:50"},{"bpm":"94","id":1844,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Supersonic","track_length":"8:42"},{"bpm":"105","id":1845,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Rasta Blasta","track_length":"7:22"},{"bpm":"88","id":1846,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Destination Unknown","track_length":"3:40"},{"bpm":"71","id":1847,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Destination Unknown - Continuous Mixed Verssion CD1","track_length":"1:08:31"},{"bpm":"86","id":1848,"release_code":"BEDEST01CD","release_id":"1363670","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Destination Unknown - Continuous Mixed Verssion CD2","track_length":"51:30"}]},{"artists":"King Unique;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Ian O'Donovan","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/d5f98c0f-3595-4f58-808d-a6b8065dc338.jpg","description":"No doubt you remember the mighty VERSUS project from John Digweed and Nick Muir from last October? The 3xCD album was a huge undertaking and as part of the package the Bedrock duo teamed up with a number of artists to create twelve exclusive new tracks. \r\n\r\nSome of the greatest house and techno talent around became involved - Christian Smith, Wehbba, Pig&Dan, Marco Bailey, Henry Saiz, Guy J, The Japanese Popstars, Carlo Lio, Jamie Stevens, Ian ODonovan, Second Hand Satellites, Jozif and Psycatron joining forces with John & Nick for this highly creative project, to produce yet more iconic tracks for the label. Ever since the VERSUS release, these originals have lit up dance floors worldwide.\r\n\r\nNow Bedrock is developing the VERSUS project further, with a series of single releases that see John & Nick invite a new group of artists to give their creative take on the original album tracks. First up was Extended Play, who got to grips with Morphism, the collaboration from John Digweed & Nick Muir Vs. Pig&Dan. Now, we move to the second exciting release, with King Unique twisting the knobs of creativity and breathing a new life into Dawnbreaker by John Digweed & Nick Muir Vs. Ian ODonovan.\r\n\r\nThe fizzing melodic techno of the outstanding original version has been given the full King Unique treatment here, with Matt Thomas keeping the melodic beauty intact and giving the track a taste of his highly original trademark combination of delicious underground house and tripped-out cosmic techno styling. This is a huge track that is sure to appeal across genre divides, so hats off to another creative master class from Bedrock.

The end results - Julienzzz flying high on a deep throbbing techno backbone overlaid with hypnotic melody flourishes, and the counterbalancing Gibsome taking on a more laidback, deeply groovy warmness and heartfelt, soulful, spiritual vibe - are nothing short of extraordinarily superb.\r\n\r\nThe creator of some of the freshest sounds in techno music in recent years, fellow Dutchman, Ramon Tapia, is also on fire here. For his remix of Julienzzz, a teasing percussive intro leads into a monstrous, infectious, booming groove that is sure to cause chaos all summer long. Italy is also strongly represented here by the super-hot production duo - Paolo Martini & Paul C, who never fail to impress. Their catchy and bouncy techno remix style rides high on a rhythm that has the groove and swing factor turned up to the max.\r\n\r\nIf you like what you hear here, then dont miss Ramon Tapias next monster release, also coming on Bedrock on June 23rd, in the form of a collaborative project with Stavroz, called Havana.","id":225,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI50","released":"2014-6-9","title":"Julienzzz / Gibsome","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":916,"release_code":"BEDDIGI50","release_id":"1315461","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Julienzzz","track_length":"7:25"},{"bpm":"125","id":917,"release_code":"BEDDIGI50","release_id":"1315461","remix_title":"Ramon Tapia Remix","title":"Julienzzz","track_length":"7:48"},{"bpm":"124","id":918,"release_code":"BEDDIGI50","release_id":"1315461","remix_title":"Paul C & Paolo Martini Remix","title":"Julienzzz","track_length":"6:35"},{"bpm":"120","id":919,"release_code":"BEDDIGI50","release_id":"1315461","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Gibsome","track_length":"8:48"}]},{"artists":"Roman Fluegel;Francesca Lombardo;Tuff City Kids;Split Secs;Acid Pauli;Nu;Extended Play;Martin Buttrich;Lutzenkirchen;Dixon;Booka Shade;King Unique;Giorgos Gatzigristos;System Of Survival;Minilogue;Just Be;Various Artists;Bassel;Tim Green;Hayley Hutchinson;Jacob Husley;August Jakobsen;jozif;Fur Coat;Douglas Greed;Cesare vs Disorder;Dave Vega;Safety Scissors;Daniel Bortz;Nils Corssen;Renegade;Psychemagik;TG;Robert Babicz;Joy Wellboy;Hot Since 82;Ferreck Dawn;Nathan Cable;Jamie Stevens;Philip Bader;Lee Van Dowski;Dean Demanuele;Harvey McKay;Humano;Federico Grazzini;Defex;Robert Dietz;Secret Knowledge;Kaiserdisco;Nicole;Cari Golden;Petar Dundov;Gregor Tresher","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/76b4549b-f185-4cad-bd74-5ddbdc3c227e.jpg","description":"Recorded at Johns last night at The Vagabond Nightclub in Downtown Miami during this years Miami Music Week, LIVE IN MIAMI features 37 tracks and nearly 4 hours of the very best underground electronic music, spanning across more than two decades.

Together with Madben he looks to launch into 2014 in grand style with the release of their Bedrock double header.","id":233,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI44","released":"2014-2-17","title":"Neighbours","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":282,"release_code":"BEDDIGI44","release_id":"1244654","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Neighbours","track_length":"8:17"},{"bpm":"126","id":283,"release_code":"BEDDIGI44","release_id":"1244654","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Breathe","track_length":"7:50"}]},{"artists":"Philogresz","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/a7c5ba4e-ea4c-402c-98d4-1e9566bde990.jpg","description":"Bedrock welcome Dutch artist Philogresz to the family with his latest track 'Mooder'. The productions of Ilker Soylu have been described as \"channeling unexpected sudden deep space or possibly even beyond that\", and when listening to Mooder you can empathise with this quote as the listener is gently drawn in by his melodic synth line and warm, pulsing bass. The clever hammer shots that evolve into robotic bird song add to the draw as Philogresz casually builds with piercing but never painful chords. Pain is the last thing we feel here as Mooder's constantly evolving composition sees that we are enveloped by the music. Smooth, steady and uplifting.","id":234,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI43","released":"2014-2-3","title":"Philogresz","tracks":[{"bpm":"122","id":540,"release_code":"BEDDIGI43","release_id":"1238392","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mooder","track_length":"6:23"}]},{"artists":"Satoshi Tomiie;Russ Gabriel;One Of Them;Guy J;John Dalagelis;Arjun Vagale;Ramiro Lopez;Nils Nuernberg;Florian Kruse;Wiretappeur;Stelios Vassiloudis;Tomomi Ukumori;Astrid Suryanto;Darren Murray","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/5f18444b-29d0-440b-a7ba-312a6978574e.jpg","description":"From ambient soundscapes, down-tempo vocal tracks and slo-mo house, through to deliciously deep experiments, firing tech-house and acid grooves, It Is What It Is, the supremely exciting double-disc debut artist album from Stelios Vassiloudis, was released on Bedrock at the tail end of 2011. Then, at the height of summer 2012, came the first of a planned series of album remix packages featuring interpretations from some of the most exciting producers from around the world, fittingly titled It Was What It Was. Now, at the start of 2014, comes the next highly anticipated, super-exciting selection of remixes.\r\n\r\nThe original album is rich with the many vocal talents it hosts, one of the most glorious contributions coming from Astrid Suryanto on Feed, giving Russ Gabriel (whose name has been synonymous with UK Techno since 1993) the perfect backdrop to create an absolutely beautiful, fresh interpretation. The brilliant One Of Them (aka New York based Niko Dalagelis) continues with the beauty theme, taking the vocal contribution of Japans Tomomi Ukomori on Green Is Blue into a deeply chilled house excursion, whilst the Japanese music master, Satoshie Tomiie, interprets things a more upbeat manner that is equally enthralling for his remix.\r\n\r\nGuy Js work is always touched with a magic and emotion that few rival and his remix of I Burn Like is yet another example of why his productions are so special. This time the enthralling original vocals of Darren Murphy are meshed into a deeply hypnotic journey. In contrast, Wiretappeur (the production partnership between Florian Kruse, Nils Nurnberg and Stelios himself) turn I Burn Like into a seductive slo-mo vocal house masterpiece.\r\n\r\nDieb Audios John Dalagelis (brother of the aforementioned Niko) was heavily involved in the original album project and returns here with a delightfully adventurous, jazz-influenced, widescreen techno take on Repetition. The superb selection of creative remixes is brought to a finale with Indias Arjun Vagale joining forces with Spains Ramiro Lopez to put together a frenetic percussive acid interpretation of What's That (odd one out here as the original track first appeared on the Bedrock 14 compilation album).\r\n\r\nAnyone open to the emotions on display here really should check out It Is What It Is, the original debut artist album by Stelios Vassiloudis, as it is much more than a collection of great tracks. Its an exceptionally exciting, bold and brave body of music that defiantly stands the test of time, beyond fickle trends and fashions, and remains a benchmark release from Bedrock to this day.","id":235,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","released":"2014-1-20","title":"It Was What It Was","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":966,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"Satoshi Tomiie Remix","title":"Green In Blue","track_length":"7:16"},{"bpm":"120","id":967,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"Russ Gabriel Remix","title":"Feed","track_length":"6:26"},{"bpm":"120","id":968,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"One Of Them Remix","title":"Green In Blue","track_length":"8:18"},{"bpm":"124","id":969,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"Guy J Remix","title":"I Burn Like","track_length":"8:39"},{"bpm":"121","id":970,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"John Dalagelis Remix","title":"Repetition","track_length":"7:43"},{"bpm":"125","id":971,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"Arjun Vagale & Ramiro Lopez Remix","title":"What's That","track_length":"8:19"},{"bpm":"100","id":972,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX2","release_id":"1224962","remix_title":"Wiretappeur Remix","title":"I Burn Like","track_length":"6:57"}]},{"artists":"Sharooz;Coyu;The Japanese Popstars;Green Velvet","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c8529fda-3cce-4b33-ba85-b4fe1937ea06.jpg","description":"HARDER... DARKER... STRONGER... was the tag-line and Disconnect/Reconnect, the third studio album from The Japanese Popstars, garnered plenty of critical praise and won the hearts and minds of many forward-thinking music fans throughout 2013, proving to be a big success for John Digweeds Bedrock label. So fittingly, it falls to Gary Curran and Gareth Donoghue to kick-off the 2014 release schedule with a timely revisit to three of the albums boldest tracks, with superb heavy-duty remixes from London based Sharooz and Barcelonas Coyu.\r\n\r\nThe mighty and melodic Vision and insanely noisy Heavy Hitter battle it out to see who can become Techno champion of the world, a duel that can only result in them both sharing the podium, being so distinctly different in attitude and being unforgettably memorable. It was the original version of Matter Of Time (featuring Green Velvet on vocals) that took the 2012 IMS by storm, catching the ears of Laurent Garnier, Francois K, Carl Cox and John Digweed, who promptly signed TJP to Bedrock. Now, for 2014, it reappears with a suitably massive Coyu Remix. With his Suara label currently one of the most prominent imprints in the world of Techno, Coyus pedigree is of the highest order and he stands as one of the most charted artists in Resident Advisor's history. Sharooz (owner of La Bombe), whose recent tracks on GND Records have been flying high, is no slouch either! His decidedly twisted remix of Heavy Hitter is impressive in the extreme and will no doubt be causing chaos everywhere it lands.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, that this next salvo from The Japanese Popstars is destined to be heard in the dirtiest of dark rooms and at the biggest nocturnal festival shows worldwide, throughout 2014 and beyond. These boys are on fire and have their gaze fixed firmly on the future.","id":236,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDTJP01D3","released":"2014-1-6","title":"Vision / Heavy Hitter","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":21,"release_code":"BEDTJP01D3","release_id":"1222373","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Vision","track_length":"6:41"},{"bpm":"125","id":22,"release_code":"BEDTJP01D3","release_id":"1222373","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Heavy Hitter","track_length":"6:10"},{"bpm":"125","id":23,"release_code":"BEDTJP01D3","release_id":"1222373","remix_title":"Sharooz Remix","title":"Heavy Hitter","track_length":"5:11"},{"bpm":"125","id":24,"release_code":"BEDTJP01D3","release_id":"1222373","remix_title":"Coyu Remix","title":"Matter Of Time","track_length":"6:24"}]},{"artists":"Maxime Dangles;Philipp Straub;caTekk;Henry Saiz;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Ian O'Donovan;Feroziana;Oniris;Pat Brooks;Marco Bailey;Filterheadz;Pig&Dan;Guy J;Robert Babicz;Electric Rescue;Gran Cavaliere;Jemmy;The Japanese Popstars;Jimmy Van M;Affkt;Luxor T;Miguel Bastida;Florian Kaltstrøm;Edu Imbernon;Triumph;Dave Angel;Stelios Vassiloudis;Sahar Z;TWO HAND SALUTE;Kurtz & Bomber;Psycatron","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/23758542-eac5-406e-bd7a-14cde827f676.jpg","description":"To celebrate Bedrocks releases from 2013 and just slightly beyond we proudly present this collection of some of our biggest releases from the last 12 months.Thank you for your support on our releases and our artists.","id":237,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI42","released":"2013-12-23","title":"Best Of Bedrock 2013","tracks":[{"bpm":"123","id":1936,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Dawnbreaker","track_length":"8:25"},{"bpm":"122","id":1937,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Final Touch","track_length":"7:36"},{"bpm":"128","id":1938,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Rebirth","track_length":"9:31"},{"bpm":"125","id":1939,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mansion","track_length":"7:34"},{"bpm":"124","id":1940,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Sudden Rush","track_length":"8:19"},{"bpm":"121","id":1941,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Twenty 11","track_length":"7:40"},{"bpm":"125","id":1942,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"It Just So Happens","track_length":"6:24"},{"bpm":"125","id":1943,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Lili Reve","track_length":"15:10"},{"bpm":"125","id":1944,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Waterloo Blues","track_length":"7:02"},{"bpm":"123","id":1945,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Out Of No Where","track_length":"8:07"},{"bpm":"123","id":1946,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Dreams","track_length":"9:08"},{"bpm":"126","id":1947,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Maxime Dangles Remix","title":"Disconnect Reconnect","track_length":"7:42"},{"bpm":"123","id":1948,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Philipp Straub & CaTekk Remix","title":"Glasso Phone","track_length":"7:52"},{"bpm":"121","id":1949,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Henry Saiz Remix","title":"Veranoski","track_length":"8:32"},{"bpm":"126","id":1950,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original","title":"Harlequin","track_length":"7:52"},{"bpm":"124","id":1951,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original","title":"Coma","track_length":"11:21"},{"bpm":"125","id":1952,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original","title":"7.11","track_length":"7:27"},{"bpm":"125","id":1953,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original","title":"We Are Drum","track_length":"7:48"},{"bpm":"120","id":1954,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original","title":"Such A Rush","track_length":"7:35"},{"bpm":"126","id":1955,"release_code":"BEDDIGI42","release_id":"1217515","remix_title":"Original","title":"Awakenings","track_length":"8:04"}]},{"artists":"Pig&Dan;M.E.M.O.;Leo Samuel","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/644f25d2-0190-493a-8e98-2cf6cc357575.jpg","description":"Pig&Dan return to the label for their third full release teaming up with Spanish producer and Bedrock debutant M.E.M.O., on this new double-header.

Its not even the next applauded record to add to their intimidating catalogue. A partnership forged over countless remixes and productions, a Muir and Digweed collaboration is the meeting of two legendary minds that raise the bar for DJs and peers alike to reach up and grab. Upcoming release and unique new project Versus challenges fellow acts to do just that. Pitching head to head with the Bedrock founding members are a hand-selected display of some of the greatest house and techno talent around. Marco Bailey, Henry Saiz, and Christian Smith & Wehbba are amongst a host of diverse acts that caught the forerunners attention for their distinctive sound and prowess in the studio over recent years to join them on Versus. Coming via their esteemed imprint, this brand new 3-part concept album is out on the 7th October for the entire world to revel in.This album will position itself atop a stunning array of equally iconic records from the Bedrock label that over the years has showcased stunning single releases, artist albums and legendary compilation mixes. Versus delivers the next masterstroke in the labels development and speaking of the perception on the album, John and Nick declared:What started out as a remix swap then an extended EP then out of nowhere after 12 months an album and with many twists and turns, Versus is finally here featuring a set of amazing collaborations and remixes with some of our favourite producers from around the world. We'd like to say a huge thank you to these brilliant artists for making this project happen. - John Digweed & Nick Muir CD 1 (Mixed by John Digweed) & CD 2 (Unmixed) feature 12 of these distinct producers that John and Nick earmarked as their current favourites. From the Techno of The Japanese Popstars to jozifs signature funk and house, John & Nick go all out on their quota of production to generate truly special cuts alongside their much respected counterparts. On the first of the three CDs, Nicks considerable musical talents blend seamlessly with Johns vision as a DJ and unparalleled passion and knowledge for what works on the dancefloor. Like the perfectly structured sets Digweed has solidified his fame for, the Versus mix ebbs and flows to searing peaks and tranquil hypnotizers that make up an assorted blend of floor filling masterworks. While on CD 2, listeners can catch each production in its own diverse and genre jumping detail. No less than leading single Awakenings with Northern Irelands finest, Psycaton. A pounding Techno fueled number, harking back to the golden age of acid tinged basslines and urgent, frenetic drums this one made Jacques Le Cont, Russ Chimes, Danny Tenaglia, Laurent Garnier and James Zabelia go crazy for, with the latter announcing he was with John we played this in Tokyo, massive track! In no doubt of making all listeners follow suit with excitement, this ones yours to own on 9th September. The 3rd and final CD is left solely to Digweed & Muir, which exhibits them at their creative best. With just a handful of productions in current circulation of the two stars locking horns, eight brand new and exclusive tracks presented by the duo is a rare treat for Bedrock fans. A beautifully sculpted mix of down tempo set closers, this concluding offering is perfect for an after hours set as it lulls and coerces the listener into a suspended dreamlike state of musical serenity. Simply titled, Electronica, its the perfect end to a perfect tri-part album. Coming as a limited edition box set and vinyl, what started out as an EP of collaborations has morphed into an index of enormous hits.","id":243,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDVS01CD","released":"2013-10-7","title":"John Digweed & Nick Muir - Versus","tracks":[{"bpm":"124","id":1721,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Continuous Mixed Version By John Digweed","track_length":"1:17:26"},{"bpm":"126","id":1722,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mantis","track_length":"7:29"},{"bpm":"126","id":1723,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Morphism","track_length":"7:55"},{"bpm":"125","id":1724,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Blue Tongue","track_length":"7:15"},{"bpm":"126","id":1725,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Infinity Road","track_length":"6:57"},{"bpm":"126","id":1726,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Red Tape","track_length":"6:34"},{"bpm":"124","id":1727,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Prism","track_length":"7:56"},{"bpm":"123","id":1728,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Dawnbreaker","track_length":"8:25"},{"bpm":"132","id":1729,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Iridium Flares Mix","title":"Forge","track_length":"8:16"},{"bpm":"121","id":1730,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Lupine","track_length":"8:36"},{"bpm":"120","id":1731,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Groove Del Verano","track_length":"8:02"},{"bpm":"124","id":1732,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Heaven Scent","track_length":"8:58"},{"bpm":"126","id":1733,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Stripped Mix","title":"Awakenings","track_length":"8:02"},{"bpm":"92","id":1734,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Buried Heart","track_length":"6:09"},{"bpm":"105","id":1735,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Bubblenet","track_length":"5:50"},{"bpm":"107","id":1736,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Timestone","track_length":"4:18"},{"bpm":"101","id":1737,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Larco","track_length":"4:47"},{"bpm":"103","id":1738,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Hollow World","track_length":"7:13"},{"bpm":"113","id":1739,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Circle Square","track_length":"8:51"},{"bpm":"105","id":1740,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Prism","track_length":"5:43"},{"bpm":"94","id":1741,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Gigawave","track_length":"8:25"},{"bpm":"103","id":1742,"release_code":"BEDVS01CD","release_id":"1153130","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"John Digweed And Nick Muir - Versus - Electronica Continuous Mix By John Digweed","track_length":"51:20"}]},{"artists":"Dusty Kid;Electric Rescue","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/b6cf4fd1-17e9-4d9f-ae94-eb1334c3cb3f.jpg","description":"Silky is the second single to be taken from this summers critically acclaimed Electric Rescue album - Sonic Architecture (BEDER01CD).

Most recently he and Oliver Lieb teamed up to bring us their Collaborations album release in 2012 as well as his \"We Are Children\" track which featured on John Digweed's Structures Two CD in 2011.\r\n\r\nNow in 2013, Jimmy Van M is back on Bedrock and this time he has teamed up with Spanish producer AFFKT and Argentinean Producer/Singer Luxor T. Jimmy Van M and Luxor T have been working for more than a year now together and currently working an album project. Luxor T a trained musician and Jimmy´s production experience on the dancefloor is hitting the right combination for freshly unique tracks each time. AFFKT heard one of Jimmy´s new tracks feat Luxor T - Like U and liked the vocal. When talking they agreed to try an original together with Luxor T vocals which is how Dreams came into play and rest fell into place easy with great vibes.  Working together on this project AFFKT and Jimmy Van M feed off the creativity and positive enthusiasm to make quality music, you can hear they are into it and having fun. \r\n\r\nThe result is Dreams which is a bass driven track that builds and builds with swung percussion creating a relentless groove with Luxor T's vocal layered perfectly over it all with an almost hypnotic effect. For those who prefer the dub vibe there is stripped back version of Dreams without the vocal which features extended pads and toughened up percussion. The final piece is Lucid which is a much more heads down affair for a darker and trippier ride than Dreams which will be perfect for tougher and techier sets. All in all a quality package that should have something for everyone and as we have witnessed John Digweed successfully road testing all of them over the past few months we know they rock on the dancefloor.

The 3rd installment, with previous sessions coming from Cordoba, Argentina which highlighted Johns deeper sound and ability to warm up the crowd and London, UK, which was an epic 5 hour journey from the start of the evening. Slovenia sees John condensing the pure peak time essence of his mesmerizing club set into a double LIVE mix CD. Meticulously molding and mixing across House and Techno, the journey will leave you in no question that once again, John Digweed is presenting the freshest music in his unequivocal trade mark style.There is a reason why John Digweed is still at the top of his game and still regarded as one of the true pioneers of Electronic music. Hes always had a staunch refusal to follow trends, instead traveling his own path. Digweed is a true House ambassador of deep beats, dark drums, tantalizing Techno that create the true Vortex of Electronica that has become his recognized sonic signature. With festival DJ set`s at Timewarp, Awakenings, Tomorrowlands, Movement and Electric Zoo to stand alone sold out gigs from North and South America to Australia and Asia and everything in between, Digweed is a DJ who`s passion for his craft has made him more in demand more than ever before. As his new 12 week residency at Pacha in Ibiza over the summer illustrates. It`s John`s ability to be versatile and play a set that is tailored to each night that makes him stand out and these \"Live in\" mixes really capture a snapshot of what John does at some of the best parties across the world.With tracks from true scene pioneers such as Josh Wink, Jesper Dahlback and Booka Shade sit side by side with new wave producers making an impact on the scene such as Danny Serrano, Coyu and George Fitzgerald. And remixes including Boys Noize, Kaiserdisco and Monika Kruse from the likes of The Chemical Brothers, Sébastien Léger, Ramon Tapia, Deetron and Pig&Dan go a long way towards making this a truly versatile and genre breaking mix.","id":253,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDSLOCD1","released":"2013-5-27","title":"John Digweed - Live In

returns to Bedrock with a stunning new single. Harlequin displays his supremely groovy and downright funky side, having evolved and matured stylistically over the years, since his early heart-stopping techno outings more than 3 decades ago now. This is Dave Angels first outing on Bedrock since 2011, when his remix of Marco Baileys Rubber Band (BEDMBDIGI01) was hailed as a pure master-class in techno genius.The son of a jazz musician, Dave Angels first musical instrument (appropriately) was a drum at age of eight, so its no surprise that he developed an ear for a good groove. Since entering the consciousness of the techno community in 1990, he has pretty much remained there ever since. Although hes London born and bred, he has been making records like he's from Detroit with a distinctive twist of funk and jazz for years. Dave Angel is one of the scenes true characters, giving off an aura of positivity like no other, a kind of warmth that you cannot fail to feel through his exceptional, uplifting music.","id":255,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI34","released":"2013-5-6","title":"Harlequin","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":129,"release_code":"BEDDIGI34","release_id":"1079417","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Harlequin","track_length":"7:52"}]},{"artists":"Marco Bailey;Filterheadz;Stelios Vassiloudis;Guy J;Robert Babicz;Phonogenic;Ian O'Donovan;Rob Hes;Elio Riso;Pig&Dan;Eagles & Butterflies;Edu Yattah;The Japanese Popstars","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/8714d5c9-39f0-4356-848d-d94667193020.jpg","description":"Bedrock are proud to present their Underground Sound of Miami Series 2 release.

Meanwhile, fellow Belgians Filterheadz remixed John Digweed and Nick Muirs classic Emerald back in 2003 and have been releasing music on labels such as Intec, 1605, Respekt, Toolroom and MB Elektronics for over 10 years now. After a short break, they returned to the techno scene in summer 2012 and havent dropped out of the Beatport Techno Top 100 since!\r\n\r\nHaving been friends with Marco for over a decade, they started doing some studio sessions together a few months ago and there was such a great chemistry they have emerged with these two killer tracks. Fifth Avenue continues to raise the bar where Marco Baileys excellent Watergate EP (BED85) left off a couple of years ago, teamed with the energetic Mansion it forms a perfect peak-time package.","id":258,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI32","released":"2013-3-4","title":"Mansion/Fifth Avenue","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":1144,"release_code":"BEDDIGI32","release_id":"1046719","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mansion","track_length":"7:34"},{"bpm":"125","id":1145,"release_code":"BEDDIGI32","release_id":"1046719","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Fifth Avenue","track_length":"6:46"}]},{"artists":"TWO HAND SALUTE","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/da29f19d-23b1-4a10-a838-ca652aeec1bf.jpg","description":"Two Hand Salute is two excellent producers - Gary Curran (from The Japanese Popstars) & Kev McCool this project is spawned from a yearning to go back to House and Tech House roots.

Spains Miguel Bastida and Austrias Florian Kaltstrøm have joined forces with Florians fellow countrymen Emil Berliner, Philip Straub and Christoph Abele (aka caTekk) to great a stunning 4-track EP to kick off 2013 in style.\r\n\r\nBehind The Mirror is all about elegant rhythms, powerful percussion, deep, driving bass and brooding atmospheres, making it a standout track. Emil Berliner (who takes his artist name from the German-born American inventor who is best known for developing the disc record gramophone in the 1890s) takes things into deeper tech-house territory with his delicious dub-influenced tech re-work.\r\n\r\nGlasso Phone develops a more organic vibe with vocal snippets over a hypnotic, hissing, percussive backdrop. This is a theme that is expanded upon by Philipp Straub and CaTekk as they develop an absorbing rollercoaster bass heavy groove with their unforgettable remix.\r\n\r\nThe De Barcelona a Viena EP is the first of many exciting new releases coming on Bedrock in 2013.

You will hear more than 50 tracks and remixes from some of the worlds best underground producers, including the likes of Simian Mobile Disco, Tiga, Deetron, Gabriel Ananda, Robert Babicz, Max Cooper, Ben Pearce, jozif, Kollektiv Turmstrasse, Luca Bacchetti, Todd Bodine, Pig & Dan, Butch, Paul Ritch, Justin Martin, Catz 'n Dogz, SIS, Smash TV, Julian Jeweil, Subb-an, Phonogenic, Technasia, Guy J, Heiko Laux & Diego Hostettler and many others. Live In London is a flawless journey through some of the most exciting current electronic dance music, all programmed and mixed to perfection, forming the perfect snapshot of one of the best Bedrock events of the year.\r\n\r\n\"The Bedrock Anniversary parties in London are always truly special as it feels like coming home to me. For some reason this party seemed extra special, Fire in Vauxhall is a new venue for us and it has a labyrinth of rooms under the arches which allowed us to feature a line up that most festivals would be happy with! There was definitely a magical vibe in the air when I arrived. I had heard that people had travelled from Russia, America, all over Europe, even New Zealand, to be there. The party was perfect for me, the amazing international crowd created an incredible atmosphere all night long. I love DJing more than ever these days, so to get to play for over 8 hours to an up for it crowd like that, was just pure heaven. This is the first time I have released a 4xCD live mix from one of my gigs and I hope it brings back some great memories for those who were there. If you couldnt make it, turn the lights down low, turn the volume up loud and I think youll understand. I hope you enjoy listening as much as I did playing.\" John Digweed","id":262,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDLDNCD1","released":"2012-12-3","title":"John Digweed - Live In

exclusive and huge highlight in John Digweeds DJ sets for the past few months, Coma, by the superbly talented Greek producer Stelios Vassiloudis, is now ready for release on Bedrock. It also features prominently in the mix on John Digweeds forthcoming Live In London (4xCD) album.Both the gloriously epic melodic house style of Coma and the more twisted vibe of accompanying track, No Sleep, reflect a new supremely dancefloor orientated direction for Stelios Vassiloudis, as he starts work in the new year on the follow-up to his 2011 debut artist album It Is What It Is.These super exciting new tracks, along with his recent output on Bedrock, such as Hit The Lights (featured on Live In Cordoba) and \"What's That?\" (a highlight on Bedrock 14 along with his stunning remix of Jemmy's \"Quarry Bank\") are indicative of what is on the horizon for his highly anticipated new album in 2013.These 2 new tracks are a little more epic in scope than the stuff I often play in my sets, but I'm really lucky to have someone as prolific and obliging as John Digweed to test them out for me and share his thoughts.

His love of exoticism and strange natural/organic sounds (his own label is called Natura Sonoris - which means Nature of Sound) provide the fuel for this latest stunning Bedrock release.\r\n\r\nThe Cryptozoologist has an instantly striking, mysterious Andean / Peruvian melodic influence that harks back to cultures shrouded in the mysteries of time, creating a truly haunting track. Uncharted is equally hypnotic and enthralling and yet distinctly different. Henry is using a lot of analogue vintage gear to create his music, which is giving him a very distinct sound, a path that will lead to his hotly awaited debut artist album (due out in April 2013) on which he will delve totally into and explore an analogue world (www.wearehenrysaiz.com).\r\n\r\nHenry's critically acclaimed Balance 019 album, released in 2011, was the catalyst for his star potential explode around the globe. His superb collaboration with Guy J (Meridian) and his solo track (La Marea) for the landmark Bedrock 100 release, were of the highest level of quality and his most recent release, Our Discovery (Natura Sonoris), became a huge Ibiza hit this summer, with supporters including John Digweed, Sasha, M.A.N.D.Y., Luciano, Visionquest, Danny Howells and many others.

With a mixture of Bedrock favourites and fresh new producers this album shows that Bedrock is always committed to finding the best electronic music out there. - John Digweed\r\n\r\nThe wealth of artists involved for Bedrock 14 is truly amazing. This 2012 label compilation captures the essence of why electronic dance music is such an exciting prospect right now by showcasing amazing underground talent, both established and new. \r\n\r\nWhat a dream start to what should be a highly successful career for Eagles & Butterflies. The album opens with the beautifully mellow Kollekt, the first of two debut tracks (the other being the equally adventurous Stimmer) from this new artist. Likewise, Kurtz & Bomber, an exciting collaboration between Troy Kurtz & Panic Bomber (Richard Haig) from Miami, USA debut here with the incredibly infectious vocalized Never Sleeping.\r\n\r\nJohn Digweeds ability to draw together an exciting array of international talent into one cohesive whole is pretty much unparalleled. Resistance by Stuttgarts Solee, shows exactly why he crosses divides and spans genres with his distinctive take on evocative melodic techno. Spains Paneoh (who also appeared on Structures 2 and Live In Cordoba) displays all his hyper-energetic twisted brilliance on Vetabom, while one of Australias most talented and sought after music producers, Infusions Jamie Stevens, makes a welcome return to Bedrock (after his exceptional remix of John Digweeds Warung Beach) with Indigo.\r\n\r\nRising UK star, Liverpools Jemmy, is given the lush remix treatment on his hypnotic Quarry Bank track by Greeces Stelios Vassiloudis, whose critically acclaimed debut album, It Is What It Is, showed the world that variety is indeed the spice of life. So, its no wonder that Stelios makes three appearances on Bedrock 14, adding his wild acidic grooved Whats That? to the proceedings and teaming up with Florian Kruse and Nils Nurnberg as Wiretappeur for Iridescent, another example of this trios highly original and deep understanding of the power of melody.\r\n\r\nBedrocks new talent is in exceptional form throughout. Canadas Maher Daniel teams up NYCs Nikko Gibler for the low-slung, spiralling beauty of Ill Wait For You. Maxime Dangles has grown to be a key new artist in the French avant-garde electronic music community and is creating waves around the globe with his unabashed approach to proper club techno music, so its not surprise that Unsteady Curve is yet another example of his amazing music. Fellow rising French star, Antoine Husson (aka Electric Rescue), brings his distinctive brand of ultra-dynamic techno and sensuality to the party with an exceptional remix of John Digweed & Nick Muirs Raise and his own monster creation, Stucked Ship.\r\n\r\nIsraeli producer Guy J has become one of the most sophisticated and emotive producers in electronic music over the last decade, with a body of work and a sphere of influence that belies relatively short time in the spotlight. With the melody-rich and emotionally charged Mish Mash, he shows exactly why he is one of the most inspirational artists in the world. As are Spains Marc Marzenit and Henry Saiz, whose Sirens Land explains why their complex and emotive form of electronic club music is exciting so many people right now.\r\n\r\nSo much exceptional talent is on display on Bedrock 14 and we havent even mentioned Germanys Robert Babicz, whose music career already spans two decades. The mark of a true musical innovator, he continues to reveal his talent and skill as one of Europe's most essential techno producers here with another stunning creation, Eastside. Then theres another Bedrock favourite, the techno tastemaker Christian Smith with The Judgement, showing exactly why he has operated at the top of his game for over a decade now. The chiming keys of Marco Baileys Whispering Leaves effortlessly lift the proceedings to anthem level and Quivver (aka world-renowned DJ/producer/songwriter John Graham) never fails to impress, Fakes and Bullshit sending out a clear message.\r\n\r\nIf youre talking about exciting underground producers, two of the first names out of anyones hat should always be Igor Tchkotoua and Dan Duncan (aka Pig & Dan) and their intense Crazy is surely a highlight here too. Finally, its fitting that John Digweed and Nick Muir, producers of the finest electronic dance music, bring the show to a close with their Trezz Intro interlude, since between them they have been involved in many pivotal moments in the world of club music over the years and have in many ways helped to define genres & push the boundaries further. With Bedrock 14, the label also shows that it is not resting on past laurels but always moving forward, developing in an exciting direction.\r\n\r\nSo, once again, its hats off to Bedrock for raising the bar even higher with this exceptional compilation featuring 21 exclusive tracks from some of the worlds finest artists. In this day and age to not only survive as an independent label, but also to flourish and constantly evolve, bringing forward new and exciting talent, is something that should be applauded. Anyone with even just a passing interest in quality electronic music needs to think very seriously before leaving this collection on the shelf.\r\n\r\nPre-order now for a special signed limited edition slipcase version exclusively at http://www.bedrockmusic.bigcartel.com/","id":266,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED14CD","released":"2012-10-8","title":"Bedrock 14 Compiled By John Digweed","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":1915,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Kolleckt","track_length":"7:41"},{"bpm":"122","id":1916,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Iridescent","track_length":"7:08"},{"bpm":"124","id":1917,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"I'll Wait For You","track_length":"8:35"},{"bpm":"123","id":1918,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Crazy","track_length":"8:23"},{"bpm":"124","id":1919,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Vetabom","track_length":"8:07"},{"bpm":"124","id":1920,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Judgement","track_length":"7:37"},{"bpm":"125","id":1921,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Sirens Land","track_length":"8:13"},{"bpm":"125","id":1922,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Fakes And Bullshit","track_length":"7:30"},{"bpm":"124","id":1923,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Mish Mash","track_length":"7:34"},{"bpm":"126","id":1924,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Whispering Leaves","track_length":"7:12"},{"bpm":"114","id":1925,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Never Sleeping","track_length":"5:24"},{"bpm":"124","id":1926,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Quarry Bank","track_length":"7:49"},{"bpm":"125","id":1927,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Stimmer","track_length":"6:38"},{"bpm":"122","id":1928,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"What's That?","track_length":"7:33"},{"bpm":"126","id":1929,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Indigo","track_length":"7:11"},{"bpm":"122","id":1930,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Electric Rescue Remix","title":"Raise","track_length":"8:59"},{"bpm":"125","id":1931,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original","title":"Resistance","track_length":"8:05"},{"bpm":"123","id":1932,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original","title":"Unsteady Curve","track_length":"6:43"},{"bpm":"124","id":1933,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original","title":"Eastside","track_length":"7:09"},{"bpm":"124","id":1934,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Original","title":"Stucked Ship","track_length":"7:22"},{"bpm":"128","id":1935,"release_code":"BED14CD","release_id":"976265","remix_title":"Intro","title":"Trezzz","track_length":"2:53"}]},{"artists":"Electric Rescue;Nick Muir;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/52af4965-fada-4fa3-8208-24c2dc395774.jpg","description":"With a huge buzz already building around the forthcoming Bedrock 14 album, featuring a stunning remix of Raise by Electric Rescue, here comes the spine-tingling, big-room beast of an original version from John Digweed and Nick Muir, accompanied by two additional remixes from the rising French techno star.In its original form Raise is super-energetic, brimful with tension.

Now, at the height of summer 2012 comes the first of a series of superb album remix packages featuring interpretations from some of the most exciting producers from around the world, fittingly titled It Was What It Was.Jim Rivers is a British innovator, always moving forward in the ever-evolving world of electronic music, crossing the many bridges between house and techno with relaxed dignity. Here he blends techno and acid elements with immense skill, creating a worthy, anthemic interpretation of the deeply delicious original version of Small Hours.Stelios teamed up with like-minded producer, Berlin based Sasse, for one of his album highlights, The Z, so remixing such a superb original track would always be a tricky task. São Paulos rising global star, Wehbba has stepped up to the plate and created a percussive hook-laden melodic beauty in his inimitable South American style, that is bound to impress.The album is also rich with the many vocal talents it hosts, with one of the most glorious contributions coming from Astrid Suryanto on WalkAway. So, who better than USAs Ryan Cavanagh (aka Slow Hands) to create this sunshine filled mellow interpretation? As one of the main proponents of the current slow-mo and sultry house revolution, his creations bear all the hallmarks of years of classical and compositional training. Aiming to elevate electronic music to wholly new and rewarding creative planes with his approach to creating songs, not tracks, Slow Hands is about emotion, about warmth, about creative freedom. His interpretation of Walk Away is sure to leave you with smile on your face and a glow in your heart.","id":269,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDSVRMX1","released":"2012-8-13","title":"It Was What It Was","tracks":[{"bpm":"123","id":11,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX1","release_id":"953624","remix_title":"Jim Rivers Remix","title":"Small Hours","track_length":"7:34"},{"bpm":"124","id":12,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX1","release_id":"953624","remix_title":"Wehbba Remix","title":"The Z","track_length":"7:11"},{"bpm":"114","id":13,"release_code":"BEDSVRMX1","release_id":"953624","remix_title":"Slow Hands Remix","title":"Walk Away","track_length":"7:04"}]},{"artists":"Electric Rescue;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Stephan Bodzin","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/e421dbd1-04a7-4d4c-89ac-4bc22a6431ea.jpg","description":"The reception for Electric Rescues original version of Dope (BEDDIGI13), released at the tail end of 2011, was nothing short of exceptional.

Underground and eclectic, it went overground in a big way! \r\n\r\nNow, Bedrock brings you an absolutely superb remix package that is sure to cause a equally huge commotion. Electric Rescue revisits Dope and tweaks and twists the original into a brand new (and no less massive) anthem for summer 2012. On remix duty, John Digweed and Nick Muir show that they never rest on past laurels and are always developing their sound in an exciting direction, by producing a massive, low-slung, throbbing house interpretation.

Now, he returns to Bedrock in the summer of 2012 with the stunning 5-track Hold Up EP.From the intense, swirling, spiralling climaxes of the title track; through the mind-bending, warped energy of Jarten; the glorious nagging hook of My Boo; Spagetjacks nod to Giorgio Moroder; to the distorted Detroit attitude of Transparence, this is an EP bursting with hypnotic melodic swing and well-timed hands-in-the-air moments. With such an exciting musical palette to play with, Maxime Dangles cannot fail to impress even the most tired of ears.Born in 1985, Maxime discovered the world of nightclubbing at a very young age. He quickly became an excellent DJ but crucially also learnt how to create his own music. In 2004, he started to work on remixes and edits before developing his own musical imprint, which led to releasing tracks with the famous Kompakt label in 2006. Remixes of Scan X, Miss Kittin & The Hacker, Simian Mobile Disco, Royksopp, Moby etc have followed.

This is another absolutely masterful creation from Christian Smith, making this an EP you dont want to miss out on!Christian Smith has been at the top of his game as a DJ and producer for over a decade, but despite enjoying a global reputation as one of the most evergreen performers in his field, times have never been quite as good as they are right now. While his roots lie in techno, Christian has never been a purist, favouring instead to flavour the melodic, rhythmical music he loves with doses of funk or interspersing the raw energy of his sets with inspired moments of pure euphoria. His big-room, genre-blurring sound is very much suited to the Bedrock ethos of releasing the best quality electronic dance music that goes beyond fads and fashion as this brand new EP demonstrates. With the momentum of his recent successful releases firmly behind him and with the strength of fresh inspiration driving his ambition forward, the Carambola EP shows once again exactly why Christian Smith remains at the top of his game, maintaining his relevance and position at the very pinnacle of electronic music in 2012.","id":273,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI21","released":"2012-5-21","title":"Carambola EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":228,"release_code":"BEDDIGI21","release_id":"913253","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Carambola","track_length":"7:44"},{"bpm":"126","id":229,"release_code":"BEDDIGI21","release_id":"913253","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Carambola Green","track_length":"8:14"}]},{"artists":"Gorge;Martin Buttrich;Kollektiv Turmstrasse;Stephan Bodzin;Dixon;Nic Fanciulli;The Martinez Brothers;Tood Bodine;Ame;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Nick Curly;Marc Marzenit;Ewan Pearson;Philip Bader;Nicone;Sascha Braemer;Francys;Yooj;Robert Babicz;Dominik Eulberg;Pig&Dan;Sirenize;Gavin Herlihy;Soulade;Paneoh;Agoria;Scalde;Mark Reeve;Subb-an;Shiva;Fosky;Mikh Solvis;Guy J;Stelios Vassiloudis;Maetrik;Sissy;Luca Morris;Rodamaal;Claudia Franco;Slam;Zoo Brazil;Oliver Lieb;Sian;Dosem;Boys Noize;Erol Alkan;Jarvis Cocker","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/7d062d73-3167-4021-938c-31afd7fc4610.jpg","description":"Three months on from his truly historic 5-hour marathon set at the open-air Tres Aguas venue in Cordoba, Argentina at the start of 2012, UK legend John Digweed looks back and then forward as he prepares to share the magic and indulge those not fortunate enough to attend that unforgettable January night. \r\n\r\nSo unbelievably special was the occasion both for John and the thousands of party-goers who bore witness that on 30th April, the Bedrock head-honcho will release his brand new triple CD package Live in Cordoba, giving Digweed fans across the world the chance to experience and reminisce upon what was, in his own words, one of the best party atmospheres [hes] ever experienced.\r\n\r\nComplete with two Live Mix CDs (1&2) and a third bonus disc featuring exclusive un-released and most importantly unmixed cuts from Digweeds bag, the Live in Cordoba triple long player captures so exquisitely the innate capacity John has for manipulating and executing sounds and continuously wowing a crowd for hours on end with impeccable record selection. \r\n\r\nCD 1 showcases John`s ability to set the mood with grooving house and forward thinking techno tracks with remixes from the likes of Agoria, Martin Buttrich, Robert Babicz, Dominik Eulberg, Stephan Bodzin and Subb_an. \r\n\r\nCD 2 sees John shift gears with chunky beats and driving techno from Maetrik, Alljacks, Oliver Lieb, Boys Noize & Erol Alkan, Nick Curly and Guy J, among others. \r\n\r\nCD 3 Sees John with his A&R hat on, compiling 10 fantastic, new and unmixed tracks from Sian, Pig&Dan, Dosem and an exclusive remix of Slam`s classic Eterna remixed by John Digweed and Nick Muir. \r\n\r\n\"I could see from the reaction to my very first record that this crowd was there to party and were totally united under the stars, creating one of the best party atmospheres I have experienced in a long while. I played for over 5 hours and really didn't want to stop, as I was having so much fun. Fortunately I recorded the set and I hope that this live CD helps to capture some of the energy from such an amazing party. Thanks to everyone who was there for creating such a memorable and special night. \"\r\n\r\nJohn Digweed Live in Cordoba will be released on 30th April 2012 on Bedrock Records. \r\n\r\nAvailable on

Having previously released tracks on Sven Vaths Cocoon Recordings, Boys Noize Records, Sci + Tech, AFU limited, Communiqué, Subject and Sign Industry, he first unleashed his distinctive brand of ultra dynamic techno and sensuality on John Digweeds Bedrock label at the tail end of 2011.Dope (BEDDIGI13) was a huge tune for Laurent Garnier, Sasha, Secret Cinema, Guy J, Hernan Cattaneo, Nick Warren and Dave Seaman, amongst a plethora of diverse DJs worldwide. Now Electric Rescue returns to Bedrock with the super-strong Lili EP, featuring three killer tunes.Lili has all the ingredients to be a massive tune all summer long. Combining melodic techno attitude with a big room mentality, it has all the right ingredients. Already a huge tune in John Digweeds sets, this is going to explode to anthem status worldwide over the coming months. With the equally exciting Opened Hands and Science revealing an experimental and diverse side to the Electric Rescue musical palette, this is a very exciting EP package indeed.Electric Rescues reputation is already flying high in France through his residency at the Rex Club (Skryptöm parties) and organising the Play rave parties in Paris, Antoine Husson is most definitely a man to watch in 2012.","id":276,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI19","released":"2012-4-2","title":"Lili Ep","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":106,"release_code":"BEDDIGI19","release_id":"889418","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Lili","track_length":"10:17"},{"bpm":"125","id":107,"release_code":"BEDDIGI19","release_id":"889418","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Opened Hands","track_length":"8:19"},{"bpm":"127","id":108,"release_code":"BEDDIGI19","release_id":"889418","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Science","track_length":"8:19"}]},{"artists":"Sirenize;Stelios Vassiloudis;Robert Babicz;Sasse;Guy J;Maher Daniel;Casa (Aka Mike Casa);Wehbba;Pig&Dan;Mark Reeve;Dean Demanuele;Electric Rescue;Timid Boy;Dosem","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/8b548341-544c-40ba-93af-8ba0010893b0.jpg","description":"Bedrock_Underground Sound Of Miami features 10 exclusive tracks from some of Bedrocks favourite artists and some exciting new names to the Bedrock roster, in a DJ-friendly unmixed format.\r\n\r\nWe've been wanting to do a Miami sampler for the last few years now, showcasing some of the great artists we work with on the label but other projects and releases got in the way of letting us do this. However this year we have been very fortunate to be in a position where we not only had some amazing music but also some time to get this organised so we could do it properly. I have also been able to road test all of the tracks at gigs since the start of January and the reactions to the music has been amazing so it seemed perfectly apt to put a release together that we can focus on around Miami and the Bedrock showcase parties there. - John Digweed\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wealth of artists involved is truly amazing and it was great to get Pig&Dan involved along with artists who we have worked with in the past, like Robert Babicz, Wehbba, Guy J and Stelios Vassiloudis. Ultimately, I'm really happy with the release and can foresee a lot of these tracks carrying on into the summer season for a lot of DJs. - John Digweed\r\n\r\nAs we head towards the month of March theres earnest debate on various noteworthy music sites about Miami WMC 2012, but there can be no doubt that there will be magical moments that will be talked about for months to come. The Bedrock showcase at Cameo (Thursday 22nd March) featuring John Digweed, Hernan Cattaneo, Guy J, Marco Bailey, Omid 16B, Henry Saiz, Denis A and Stelios Vassiloudis, will be an amazing party, as will John Digweeds extended set at the Bedrock and Creations party on Saturday 24th at The Vagabond in downtown Miami. Bedrock_Underground Sound Of Miami captures the essence of why electronic dance music is such an exciting prospect right now, showcasing the amazing underground talent, both established and new.\r\n\r\nTake, Sirenize, the latest project involving Rowan Blades and rising star Dennis White (aka Thermal Bear on Traum). This duo never compromises, always staying true to the underground with a strict artistic ethos & integrity, as opening track, Everybody, proves.\r\n\r\nFrom ambient soundscapes, downtempo vocal tracks and slo-mo house, through to deliciously deep house, tech-house and acid grooves, the supremely exciting debut artist album from Greeces Stelios Vassiloudis, It Is What It Is on Bedrock, showed the world that variety is the spice of life. So its no wonder that Stelios makes two appearances here: flying solo on the inspired West and teaming up with sometime collaborator Sasse (aka Klas Lindblad from Finland) on Benedict. Sasses first releases came out on the legendary Sähkö/Puu as Freestyle Man and rightly are considered a milestone in the Scandinavian house sound. His Moodmusic and Sunday Music labels are highly respected worldwide, so his production skills are up there with the best, as Benedict shows.\r\n\r\nGermanys Robert Babicz has a music career that already spans nearly two decades, comprising five albums and multiple singles. The mark of a true musical innovator, he continues to reveal his talent and skill as one of Europe's most essential techno producers. His contribution here, Echo From The Past, is yet another stunning creation from this hero to many. \r\n\r\nGuy Js brand new track Shining (BEDGJDIGI01) and the hot remixes of tracks from his critically acclaimed 1000 Words album, have been setting floors alight since the start of 2012, so its no surprise that Nightstalker is yet another absolute gem. As one of the standout electronic artists in the world today, Guy J is at the forefront of a movement towards the melody-rich and emotionally charged roots of the house music spectrum. \r\n\r\nCanada's Maher Daniel & Casa (aka Mike Casa) are both upcoming, pivotal figures on the Montreal scene. Daniels remix of Tone Depth's 'Rumblefish' (Bedrock) was #1 on Beatport's techno charts for over two and a half months, cementing a relationship with the label that sees Music, Machines & Life introducing a very exciting vibe to the proceedings here. A low-slung, heavy hitting tech monster is the order of the day.\r\n\r\nHailing from Brazil, Wehbba is one of the latest additions to Brazil's fine history of innovative techno producers. He made a big impression with his remix of Christian Smiths Flyertalk on John Digweeds Structures album, leading this dentist graduate, licensed diver and Jiu Jitsu fighter to have his debut track, Mammut included on Bedrock 12. Now, with the bouncy percussive beauty of Motone he makes an exciting, welcome return. \r\n\r\nIf you're talking about exciting underground producers it would be rude not to mention Igor Tchkotoua and Dan Duncan (aka Pig&Dan), since 1999 their distinctive mixture of influences has given them a sound that is both innovative and easily recognizable. Their Sonic Society label and relationship with Sven Vaths Cocoon family have led to global respect for this dynamic duo. Teaming up with English ex-pat, Mark Reeve and Maltas Dean Demanuele has led to a truly international melting pot of hip-swinging, groovy rhythms on Machines.\r\n\r\nFew French electronic music artists combine experience, avant-gardism and guaranteed success on dance floors as Electric Rescue (aka Antoine Husson) does. His distinctive brand of ultra-dynamic techno and sensuality has already proved itself on Bedrock. Dope (BEDDIGi13) was a Balearic techno monster, combining the elegance of Detroit attitude to the groove of a big room tune. The highly hypnotic All Access with fellow French prodigy, Timid Boy (aka Damien Almira) is equally amazing here.\r\n\r\nCatalan producer and DJ Marc Dosem is unquestionably one of the hottest rising stars in the underground electronic dance scene. His bold debut album, Parallel (Sino), was released to much critical acclaim in the summer of 2011, further cementing growing respect, having already unleashed massive tunes such as Silent Drop and Beach Kisses. Dosems stunning remix of Henry Saiz La Marea (BED100R) was a highlight of 2011. His unrivalled ability to harness glistening melodies, taking listeners on a trip through wondrous realms of emotion, are supreme on How Do You Do It, a fitting finale to what is an extraordinary collection of the finest underground electronic dance music.\r\n\r\nOnce again, its hats off to Bedrock for raising the bar even higher with this exceptional compilation. In this day and age to not only survive as an independent label, but also to flourish and constantly evolve, bringing forward new and exciting talent, is something that should be applauded.

Many years ago Jimmy was among the first people to bring Oliver to the USA to play and was the first to arrange a tour for him to perform live and now the time is right for The Audible Suspects to be born.\r\n\r\n\"After my break from producing, I was slowly getting back to working again and one of the first steps was to care about my online presence, Facebook etc. I added Jimmy, making contact again and soon we talked about working together on some projects. and quickly had the idea of doing a compilation. Like my monthly podcasts, I wanted to gather together new, interesting music from well-known and more underground or undiscovered people and focus on the techy side of things, which actually is my main playground. So, our collaboration is based on grooves and interesting sounds, as well as melodies, that dont just aim for big commercial success but more for some exciting trippy development of audible space.\" - Oliver Lieb\r\n\r\nFrankfurt based DJ & producer Oliver Lieb has been in the premier league of electronic producers since the late 90s and always keeps surprising and amazing people with his extraordinary sounds and diversity of styles. He views music as an endless horizon of expressing himself and refuses to be pigeonholed in one specific genre, an attitude well suited to the Bedrock ethos. The mighty, soaring, Parallax, was a highlight on John Digweeds Structures Two album, and the exceptional Epsilon Eridani EP (Bed99) followed last summer. So it is fitting that both an unreleased Reprise and Italian producer Davide Callis remix open and set the stage for this collaborative musical adventure.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset the selected music emulates a night out at a club with a top quality underground soundtrack, digging deep and blending subtle sparseness with hypnotic drive, teasing and building anticipation and excitement with ease. Jimmy Van M exhibits his superb remix skills reworking Origins by German techno producer Ray Kajioka, which flows seamlessly into BPitch Controls rising star Thomas Mullers One Hit One Night and on into Get Physicals Pele and Findling. Oliver and Jimmy continue to join the dots between the most exciting, talented, new producers and remixers as they feature the wildly creative Max Cooper, Andreas Mügge, in his D.Diggler guise, Daso Franke and the excitingly experimental Lanny May.\r\n\r\n\"Flow is very important. I connected with Oliver on this right from the beginning when listening to his LSG Vol. 2 and LSG Into Deep albums. Over the years weve become friends and Ive always hoped for an opportunity to work together. So, The Audible Suspects project is very exciting for me. When getting the music together for this compilation we quickly realized where it was going and took the direction of strong yet still simple tracks. We focused considerably on the sound quality of each track and the final mix mastering which you can tell by turning it up loud! \"\r\n\r\nOver the last decade and a half few individuals could claim the type behind-the-scenes influence on American dance culture as Jimmy Van M. His tireless efforts can be credited with having helped advance electronic dance music throughout the North America, opening avenues for artistic expression in dance-clubs that did not previously exist before him and his very unique efforts. When it comes to atmosphere, vibe and drive there are very few DJs that can stand alongside Jimmy Van M.\r\n\r\nThe mix builds in intensity with San Francisco duo SF/FM blurring the lines between the obscure and the straight forward, with their love of big room psychedelia, slipping effortlessly upwards with Traums Ryan Davis and Irelands Phil Kieran (who is later joined by Green Velvet for an encore performance). Swedens hugely talented techno DJ and producer Joel Mull shows off his star potential, as does the mysterious Digital Mess, before the unique sounds of Munichs Tobias Felbermayr spiral into the mix finale of Helios by Oliver Lieb.This is a mix that exhibits the best underground dancefloor attitude without sacrificing the electronic weirdness that sometimes gets lost in the pursuit of big-name tunes. There is a sense of musical maturity to the mix without it lacking in energetic charm. Its mix that is born out of desire to discover, excite and educate, and attitude that comes as the result of many years of waiting and searching for, that next inspirational track. \r\n\r\n\"Jimmy and Oliver have delivered a futuristic mix that locks you into a groove and wont let go.

In its original form it was a spine-tingling, fizzing, spiralling, big-room monster that caused a commotion everywhere, a hard act to follow? Most certainly! But John Digweeds impeccable A&R skills have not let us down with his selection of the acclaimed rising star of French techno, Julian Jeweil, to remix this beast.The Marseille born DJ/Producer has been setting the world alight with his productions on Richie Hawtins Plus8 label (Baboo and Hermanos) and Sven Vaths Cocoon (his Soho track reached No.1 in the Beatport techno chart), so its no wonder that he has delivered two stunning techno interpretations that are powerful, subtle and euphoric in perfect balance. Julian Jeweils towering talent, on display here, most definitely mark him out as someone to keep on your radar throughout 2012!For fact finders, 30 Northeast refers to the street address of Vagabond in Miami, USA. The club that so effectively captured the energy of a John Digweed DJ set that it became his first ever commercially available live DJ mix. John Digweed Live at the Vagabond, recorded at the 9th Annual Bedrock/Creations Party at Vagabond Miami 27th March 2010, was included on the Structures bonus DVD as yet another musical milestone for the label. A live mix complete with slideshow, it captured the essence of an amazing Bedrock Party for posterity www.thevagabondmiami.com.","id":280,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED97R","released":"2012-2-20","title":"30 Northeast","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":531,"release_code":"BED97R","release_id":"872003","remix_title":"Julian Jeweil Remix","title":"30 Northeast","track_length":"6:24"},{"bpm":"125","id":532,"release_code":"BED97R","release_id":"872003","remix_title":"Julian Jeweil Dub","title":"30 Northeast","track_length":"6:18"}]},{"artists":"Omid 16B","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/a7ae979d-85ea-4eee-a503-19567fed0f79.jpg","description":"Its been almost a year since Omid 16Bs previous stunning release on Bedrock. Rain and Passion Of Zorro (BEDDIGI08) were both pure examples of Omids musical genius: uplifting, anthemic and downright danceable to the extreme. As always with Omid, they grooved to the max, which is why his return to Bedrock is such an exciting prospect.The Night and Electronics are both very driving tech-house cuts with a plethora of exciting peak and drops. The Night has a more techno feel to it, created by sonically crafted layers that build it into massive bursts of energy throughout.Electronics was actually made over 3 years ago and has been rigorously tested and played out by myself many times before I signed it to Bedrock. Watch out for the bass loop drop, because that definitely gets a roar from the crowd every time! - Omid 16B Omid is an artist who isnt just a DJ/producer, but also a songwriter and musician who has played a range of musical instruments from an early age and has spent most of his life involved in music. Head of the SexOnWax, Disclosure and Alola labels, he is seen as a key tastemaker across the electronic music scene. As a respected artist of high calibre, Omid has released several albums to critical acclaim and released an epic number of amazing singles and remixes over the years. He has created a distinctive style and unique expression that constantly inspires, and is nothing short of a true showman. So you can understand why this new Bedrock release is going to cause a commotion!Omid is currently putting the finishing touches to a new 16B album that will emerge later this year.

Guy J is at the forefront of a movement towards the melody-rich and emotionally charged roots of the house music spectrum. Hes a young, innovative producer, DJ and live act, whose infectious production talents resulted in his amazing 3CD artist album (1000 Words) being acclaimed as one of the musical highlights of 2011. Now, three of the albums standout tracks have been remixed alongside a brand new track, to form the hottest package you could hope for to start the year in style.\r\n\r\nShining showcases the extraordinary talents of Guy J, from its beautifully subtle melodic intro, through a blossoming, journey-like arrangement with a highly emotive core, this is a masterful brand new track.\r\n\r\nOn 1000 Words as the mood moves towards deep, throbbing intensity, with lights down low, My Thought Of You turns up the energy levels and gets a little twisted, as Guy J pushes emotion buttons, exploring the psyche of the dance, exploring possibilities, forging ahead into the future. Which is a perfect starting point for Octopus label boss and Bedrock artist, Sian, to begin his audio experimentation on remix duty.\r\n\r\nWhen you have interests ranging from cosmology and marine biology, to the social impact of the rave generation, you tend to make unusual art and Sian stands out as a little more bohemian than the average electronic talent. Adhering more to the avant-garde side of club culture, his tracks develop an otherworldly, and hypnotic slant on techno. His reworking of My Thought Of You is yet another exceptional example of creative genius at work.\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous, heavenly vocals of Miriam Vaga feature on 3 tracks on 1000 Words with Fly providing a stunning finale to CD1, an amazing collection of the more eclectic and experimental side of Guy Js music. The original version can only be described as a listening experience that has been heaven sent, so there was only one possible choice to remix such beauty.\r\n\r\nSince they first burst onto the scene with the now classic album Wide Angle in 1999, Hybrid have been known as one of the most forward thinking and technically skilled acts in electronic dance music. Before hotfooting it over to Hollywood to work on the soundtrack for the new Terminator movie, they have made time to work their magic on Fly, and remixes dont come much bigger than this!\r\n\r\nThe heavenly atmospherics of Detroit techno bring 1000 Words to a close with the moody magnificence of Azimuth, which has been boldly taken into a new dimension by Bedrock remix competition winner, Kassey Voorn, from Athens, Greece.","id":284,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDGJDIGI01","released":"2012-1-16","title":"Shining / 1000 Words Remixes","tracks":[{"bpm":"122","id":188,"release_code":"BEDGJDIGI01","release_id":"856610","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Shining","track_length":"8:08"},{"bpm":"125","id":189,"release_code":"BEDGJDIGI01","release_id":"856610","remix_title":"Sian's Telepathic Mix","title":"My Thought Of You","track_length":"7:27"},{"bpm":"128","id":190,"release_code":"BEDGJDIGI01","release_id":"856610","remix_title":"Hybrid Soundsystem Remix","title":"Fly","track_length":"9:25"},{"bpm":"126","id":191,"release_code":"BEDGJDIGI01","release_id":"856610","remix_title":"Kassey Voorn Remix","title":"Azimuth","track_length":"8:08"}]},{"artists":"Vincenzo;Steve Bug;Ryan Davis;Tom Middleton;Robert Babicz;Alan Fitzpatrick;Oliver Lieb;Maetrik;Paneoh;Christian Smith;Marco Bailey;Elon;Psycatron;Sian;Stelios Vassiloudis;Florian Kruse;Wiretappeur;Nils Nurnberg;Sasse;Dibby Dougherty;David Young;Guy J","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/9f033741-4f90-4f2f-bdee-447e96ca8197.jpg","description":"As Bedrock are now celebrating their 13th year and about to release the 100th release on the label they are currently putting together a Bedrock Records Classic series of digital releases featuring some of the best releases and mixes from the past 13 years.

Now its time to continue the celebrations with two of the best remixes you will hear this year courtesy of the mighty Eric Prydz and one of the hottest rising stars of 2011, Spains Dosem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this day and age to not only survive as an independent label, but also to flourish and constantly evolve, bringing forward new and exciting talent, is something that should be applauded. A mark of the global respect and love that Bedrock has steadily gained through years of releasing quality dance music that rides the waves of trends and fashions is the fact that the Bed100R remixes have received over 20,000 listens on Soundcloud by word of mouth alone, before they were even officially announced! So, it is hardly surprising that this remix package is currently one of the most highly anticipated releases and quite rightly so, since it features two absolutely stunning reworks of the amazing original tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst up, Swedens superstar Eric Prydz under his Pryda guise proves he is worthy of the huge acclaim and respect he receives worldwide as he takes apart and re-designs Guy J and Henry Saizs joyously beautiful Meridian, creating a truly astonishing uplifting, anthemic remix that will surely prove to be one of THE musical highlights of 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalan producer and DJ Marc Dosem is unquestionably one of the hottest rising stars in the electronic dance scene. His bold debut album, Parallel (Sino), was released to much critical acclaim in the summer of 2011, further cementing growing respect, having already unleashed massive tunes such as Silent Drop and Beach Kisses. Dosems unrivalled ability to harness glistening melodies, taking listeners on a trip through wondrous realms of emotion, makes him the ideal candidate to rework his fellow countrymans extraordinary La Marea and his mind-blowing remix is indeed one of the best you will hear for a long, long time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again, its hats off the Bedrock for raising the bar even higher with these exceptional remixes, the mark of a truly exceptional independent dance music label.","id":294,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED100R","released":"2011-11-21","title":"Meridian / La Marea Remixes","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":1291,"release_code":"BED100R","release_id":"834843","remix_title":"Pryda Remix","title":"Meridian","track_length":"9:04"},{"bpm":"126","id":1292,"release_code":"BED100R","release_id":"834843","remix_title":"Dosem Remix","title":"La Marea","track_length":"7:09"}]},{"artists":"Guy Gerber;Kiki;Pole Folder;Stel;Marko;King Unique;Bedrock;Gutterstylz;John Digweed;KVK;Misstress Barbara;On Spec;Suicide Sports Club;Weird Continental Types;Yunus Guvenen","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/5156b076-9f26-469f-8208-9ff3d33858e4.jpg","description":"As Bedrock are now celebrating their 13th year and about to release the 100th release on the label they are currently putting together a Bedrock Records Classic series of digital releases featuring some of the best releases and mixes from the past 13 years.

The electronic music genre is wrought with sub-par, hastily produced collections of singles strung together in LP format as much as forward thinking artistic endeavours, so the prospect of making my own statement was (and is) always a very daunting prospect. - Stelios Vassiloudis\r\n\r\nPresented over two discs, the album commences with a beautiful cinematic soundscape on CD1, whereas CD2 allows Stelios to showcase his club sound, which develops from laidback deep house grooves right through to a more intense techier acidic vibe. With all the tracks blended and mixed together into a continuous play format to create the optimum listening experience, this is a fantastic release showcasing top quality, forward-thinking music and once again showing why Bedrock is one of the leading labels in the global electronic scene.\r\n\r\nYou may have already heard Stelios on Bedrock recently in his Wiretappeur guise (his collaboration with Florian Kruse and Nils Nurnberg) with the much-loved Everybody Loves Ice Cream EP whose deep house vibes and warm sounds are firm favourites of many acclaimed DJ's. Now, its time for him to shine in his own right.\r\n\r\nWhen I started work on this album a few years ago, I just wrote non-stop. For the first time in many years, I found myself enjoying the process of writing and arranging music again.\r\n\r\nCD1 is a relaxing journey through lush melodic swells, down-tempo grooves, experimental beats, subtle guitars and ambient interludes. Inspired in parts by the originality of the likes of Boards Of Canada, David Holmes and Massive Attack, this superb collection of beautiful instrumental and vocal tracks explores the possibilities and creative freedom afforded when music moves beyond the confines of the dancefloor. \r\n\r\nAs CD1 builds towards a finale, keyboards and strings give way to the stripped-back, slo-mo house of Sunrise On The Avenue which then morphs into the analogue squelch of Tie Me Up, Stelios sets the stage perfectly for what is the come on CD2 as the dancefloor beckons. If you like deeply groovy laid-back, vocal and instrumental house music with enough depth and variety to warrant many, many repeat plays before anything like over familiarity or boredom sets in, youre in for a treat. This is house music that is sophisticated, subtle, filled with hip-wiggling percussion, intensity, throbbing and ebbing and flowing through the mix with supreme ease. It is the mark of a truly creative producer that by the time the final acidic flourish of Repetition dies away, It Is What It Is feels like a truly inspired journey to the heart, mind and soul of Stelios Vassiloudis.\r\n\r\nA big part of this new found enthusiasm and creativity led me to seeking out like-minded musicians and collaborators-people that could bolster or finesse some my ideas and complete my vision. The result of these experiments and the collaborations were some of the strongest, most well rounded compositions I had put together to date and ended up forming the core of the album. \r\n\r\nThe album is rich with the many vocal talents it hosts, with glorious contributions from Darren Murray (I Burn Like), Astrid Suryanto (Walk Away and Feed), Anna Maria X (Tie Me Up and Isolation) and Tomomi Ukomori (Green In Blue), all of which are exceptional in their own distinctive styles.\r\n\r\nDarren and I started working together during the time he was doing vocals for Killahurtz and it didn't take long for me to realize what an amazingly talented and inspired musician he is. He's also tremendously underrated and not terribly prolific. However, we've worked together very happily over the years, often to great effect and his range and versatility made him the first and only choice when I was sourcing for male vocalists to sing on I Burn Like. \r\n\r\nAstrid Suryanto has an established history of working with some of the great names in electronic music such as Todd Terry, King Britt, DJ Yellow and Morgan Page, as well as a plethora of top quality labels like Nervous, Plastic City and Armada, amongst many others. Her vocal contributions on Walk Away and Feed are two of the albums highlights.\r\n\r\nI've always maintained that collaborations are tricky business. Especially when it comes to obtaining a good vocal performance that works in harmony with the music you've written. Generally speaking, vocalists either tend to have too much \"vision\" or not enough of it. Astrid is an accomplished, well-rounded songwriter as well as a first rate singer so working with her was ridiculously easy.\r\n\r\nBased in Japan, Tomomi Ukomori has worked on critically acclaimed releases with key labels in that territory like Avex, Apt International and Green Parrot Recordings, collaborating with the likes of Mathias Kaden, Hernan Cattaneo, OMB and Hideo Kobyashi. Her vocals on Blue In Green take the track to another place entirely.\r\n\r\nI met Tomomi years ago at a club I was playing at in Tokyo. After the gig, she gave me a CD of her (then) current material. I became an instant fan. From that night until today her exceptional song writing and talent have taken her far and she has created some very special pieces of music. It was a Mathias Kaden track that I heard her singing on that gave me the idea for a Japanese vocal on \"Blue In Green\". I think the juxtaposition of a very deep/techy instrumental and Tomomi's soft vocal tone make an interesting mix. \r\n\r\nAnna Maria X is a name synonymous with the music scene in Greece, whether as a DJ or a producer/singer. Anna has been one of the main names in the electronic scene, being involved in clubs, radio and, of course, a whole host of releases with her studio partner, Gpal. Her vocals on Tie Me Up and Isolation will linger in your mind for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nAs far as spoken word vocalists go, Anna Maria is up there with the best of them. It's no wonder she has a thriving side career as a voice-over specialist, the timbre of her voice is unmistakable. She knows electronic dance music. She knows what works and what doesn't. These were the fastest and easiest vocals I recorded for the album. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the many original pieces of work on this album, Stelios has also teamed up with a couple of other like-minded producers. The Z is a collaboration with Berlin based Sasse, who releases music on his esteemed Mood Music label. \r\n\r\nOur working relationship began a few years ago when we started swapping music and remixes for our 2 labels (his-Mood Music, mine-Dieb Audio). Since then we've become good friends, and worked together in various capacities, but hadnt made a complete a track together. The opportunity came up when I started \"The Z\". I had started developing the groove and main patterns but was lacking a fresh perspective, something to give it extra definition that would set it apart from your usual mid-set fodder. Sasse's touch was just what it needed and he took my initial idea in a whole new direction!\r\n\r\nJohn Dalagelis' involvement with this album project (he co-engineered and co-produced the continuous mixes) resulted in him contributing his song writing and studio finesse to \"Sunrise On The Avenue\", a DJ tool in essence, but something more sophisticated and not just a \"functional\" piece of music. John co-runs the uber-hip Dieb Audio imprint and has released music on a wide variety of labels over the years. \r\n\r\nJohn was there when I started being involved in this \"scene\". He and his brother remixed my first 2 records. Through my (and their) early development as a producer and DJ we were very tight, always bouncing ideas off each other, going out to parties, discussing music and discovering new things along the way. As a studio engineer, John is one of the best I know. He's mixed and mastered with the best and for the best. I knew I wanted his ears and his know-how when it came to putting the extra touches on the final mixes and the mixed version of the album. He ended up mastering it also.\r\n\r\nAll great albums have a secret story to tell when you scratch below the surface and It Is What It Is by Stelios Vassiloudis is a debut artist album that is more than a collection of great tracks. Across the two discs, it is a journey into the mind of a very talented musician, producer and DJ. If you are open to the emotions on display it will give you glimpses of his very heart and soul. It is an exceptionally exciting, bold and brave body of music that will stand the test of time beyond fickle trends and fashions.\r\n\r\nIve spent a year refining, rewriting, expanding and polishing the album into the two disc form it has today. In keeping with the popular paradigm, this experience has made the journey far more poignant and resounding than the end destination and has made me a better writer/producer. I guess that's what music has always been about for me-learning and evolving. A music professor at University once told me that: \"the moment you start to feel complacent and accomplished, you're finished\". My professor's words and my unwavering desire to attain (some measure of) perfection would have probably inspired and self perpetuated an endless cycle of writing, rewriting, editing and tweaking until the end of time! But, all good things must come to an end. A line must be drawn. In this light, I think the album title is self-explanatory. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I did making it? - Stelios Vassiloudis","id":298,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDSV01CD","released":"2011-11-7","title":"It Is What It Is","tracks":[{"bpm":"100","id":230,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"In Tandem","track_length":"2:34"},{"bpm":"123","id":231,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Refracting Light (Beatport Exclusive)","track_length":"8:23"},{"bpm":"100","id":232,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Entropy","track_length":"4:19"},{"bpm":"85","id":233,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Who You Are","track_length":"5:37"},{"bpm":"100","id":234,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"I Burn Like","track_length":"5:11"},{"bpm":"90","id":235,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Reshape And Reform","track_length":"7:15"},{"bpm":"90","id":236,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Your Other Left","track_length":"7:14"},{"bpm":"140","id":237,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Clarity","track_length":"4:56"},{"bpm":"128","id":238,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Walk Away","track_length":"4:39"},{"bpm":"100","id":239,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The View From Here","track_length":"4:45"},{"bpm":"100","id":240,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Highline","track_length":"5:12"},{"bpm":"105","id":241,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Sunrise On The Avenue","track_length":"5:38"},{"bpm":"105","id":242,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Tie Me Up","track_length":"4:47"},{"bpm":"118","id":243,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Small Hours","track_length":"7:03"},{"bpm":"120","id":244,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Green In Blue","track_length":"8:33"},{"bpm":"123","id":245,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Isolation","track_length":"6:53"},{"bpm":"122","id":246,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"My Leaking Vein","track_length":"8:57"},{"bpm":"120","id":247,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Feed","track_length":"8:02"},{"bpm":"123","id":248,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Blister","track_length":"8:54"},{"bpm":"123","id":249,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Reaching","track_length":"9:02"},{"bpm":"125","id":250,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Nowhere","track_length":"8:56"},{"bpm":"124","id":251,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Z","track_length":"9:54"},{"bpm":"124","id":252,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Toujours","track_length":"8:47"},{"bpm":"125","id":253,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Repetition","track_length":"9:21"},{"bpm":"100","id":254,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Continuous Mix Disc 1","track_length":"57:15"},{"bpm":"121","id":255,"release_code":"BEDSV01CD","release_id":"827323","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Continuous Mix Disc 2","track_length":"1:10:25"}]},{"artists":"Bedrock;Taiko;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Evolution;Jayn Hanna;Lemon 8;Moonface;Pole Folder;CP;Shmuel Flash;Steve Lawler;Steve Porter;John Debo;Tom Mangan;Tone Depth","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/d0a2f6ae-d3ee-4357-8b34-f73aff3c3002.jpg","description":"As Bedrock are now celebrating their 13th year and about to release the 100th release on the label they are currently putting together a Bedrock Records Classic series of digital releases featuring some of the best releases and mixes from the past 13 years.

A mark of the global respect and love that Bedrock has steadily gained through years of releasing quality dance music that rides the waves of trends and fashions is the fact that this Bed100 release received over 12,000 listens on Soundcloud before it was even officially announced!\r\n\r\nSo perhaps it is fitting to leave it to the music lovers out there to tell us what they think of this release...\r\n\r\nBrilliant choice for your 100th release John, the chaps certainly haven't let you down! Massive tune! With these two how could it be anything but great? Amazing tripping track! Super cool! Unbelievable! 2 of THE biggest producers in the scene = divine! This is perfect!!! Huge! Killer!!!! This is dream come true, great work from 2 great producers. AWESOME TRACK!!! Hell yeah! OMG!! This is massive! Insane! Amazing positive vibe! This track takes my soul back home at the sea. Beautiful track! Amazing beauty! Stunning sounds! Awesome tune!\r\n\r\nGuy J has emerged over the course of the last two years to represent an intrinsic part of the new momentum in clubland. He has been at the forefront of a movement back towards the melody rich sounds on which house music is based. His distinct style and beauty were recently showcased on his stunning 3 disc '1000 Words' (Bedrock) album, so collaborating with Spain's Henry Saiz on Meridian for Bedrock's 100th release was a match made in heaven. Henry's critically acclaimed 'Balance 019' album earlier this year has seen his star potential explode around the globe and the inclusion of his additional solo 'La Marea' track here is a mark of the highest level of quality that this extraordinarily talented young producer exhibits.\r\n\r\nHats off the Bedrock this is yet another stunning release.

Germanys Steve Bug toughens and tightens up the bottom-end, adding some superb handclaps and turning up the pressure to create a hissing intro build, before adding some stunning detuned elements into his interpretation. Finally, Spains Simon Garcia moves away from the percussion-led attitude of the previous versions, creating a more techno inspired remix, full of towering hypnotic synths and hissing hi-hats. The Z is undoubtedly a masterful creation and yet another superb package from Bedrock.\r\n\r\nYou may have already heard Stel on Bedrock recently in his Wiretappeur guise (his collaboration with Florian Kruse and Nils Nurnberg) with the much loved Everybody Loves Ice Cream EP. Wiretappeur releases regularly hit the Top 5 of the Beatport charts and their deep house vibes and warm sounds have been firm favourites of many acclaimed DJ's.\r\n\r\nWorking so closely with Bedrock has resulted in Stel signing an album deal with the label (scheduled for release in late October/early November). Along with his solo productions, the album also includes collaborations with some key artists and guest vocalists. Presented over two discs, the album commences with a beautiful cinematic soundscape on CD1 whereas CD2 allows Stel to showcase his club sound, which develops from a deep house grooves right through to a techier vibe. Both discs are exquisitely mixed, with each track immersing itself into the next and are set to become a critically acclaimed debut album from this very talented artist.\r\n\r\nStel is a musician, producer and DJ who has released music under various monikers and aliases over the last 5 years, racking up an impressive discography with, for example, releases on Bedrock, Moodmusic, Fresh Meat and Dieb Audio. His in demand production skills have also garnered numerous remix opportunities for a wide range of artists such as: John Digweed, King Roc, Sasse, Sander Kleinenberg and Shlomi Aber, among others. Some of his most vocal DJ supporters over the years have been luminaries like: Sasha, Josh Wink, Laurent Garnier, Satoshi Tomiie and Stephan Bodzin. As a DJ, Stelios has travelled all over the planet playing his particular brand of deep house and techno to enthusiastic crowds in locations as diverse and intriguing as Brazil, China, Colombia, Russia and Japan among many, many others. \r\n\r\nFor this Bedrock single release, Stel has collaborated with Sasse (aka Klas Lindblad) from Finland, whose first releases came out on Sähkö/Puu as Freestyle Man and are considered a milestone in the Scandinavian house sound with the original 12-inches still very much sought after collectors items. In 1996 he started the highly respected Moodmusic label, which was followed by the birth of Sunday Music, a musical platform for Sasse and Henrik Schwarz to release their productions. Having built his beloved BlackHead Studios in Berlin (2005) with companions Ewan Pearson and Filippo \"Naughty\" Moscatello, he recorded his debut artist album (Made Within The Upper Stair Of Heaven on Moodmusic), which was followed by the landmark Toinen (2008) album. Sasse is a DJ/producer of the highest order and his superb The Z collaboration with Stel on Bedrock is set to raise his profile even further.","id":304,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDSVS1","released":"2011-9-26","title":"The Z","tracks":[{"bpm":"124","id":266,"release_code":"BEDSVS1","release_id":"680810","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"The Z","track_length":"9:54"},{"bpm":"124","id":267,"release_code":"BEDSVS1","release_id":"680810","remix_title":"Steve Bug Remix","title":"The Z","track_length":"8:23"},{"bpm":"122","id":268,"release_code":"BEDSVS1","release_id":"680810","remix_title":"Simon Garcia Remix","title":"The Z","track_length":"7:38"}]},{"artists":"Vincenzo;Stelios Vassiloudis;Nils Nuernberg;Florian Kruse;Wiretappeur","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/8e84c318-e254-4e30-af5e-e3a99c59884b.jpg","description":"Wiretappeur is a production partnership between Florian Kruse, Nils Nurnberg and Stelios Vassiloudis (who is currently putting the finishing touches to his debut artist album for Bedrock). Their My Real Name Is track and remix of Dirty Mongrel were standout tracks on the first instalment of John Digweed's Structures series; while their two versions of Too Much Space on the Bedrock 12 compilation showed their highly original and deep understanding of the power of melody. They were also the perfect candidates to remix John Digweed & Nick Muir's Bilder (Bilder01). Now they return to Bedrock with the superb Everybody Loves Ice Cream EP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title track is pure, fresh and innovative deep house, which oozes melodic beauty and summer vibes. Wiretappeurs productions have already earned them heartfelt praise and support from many of their peers as well as a wide variety of the industry's top DJs, including Steve Bug, Luciano and Josh Wink, and Everybody Loves Ice Cream is sure to follow suit. Furry Walls is a more laid-back percussive experience, dubbed-out and spacious in structure with melodic hooks aplenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVincenzos remix of Everybody Loves Ice Cream introduces a heavier kick and ups the energy levels while slotting in an amazing dub influenced bass, which takes the track in an exciting new direction and will surely prove to be a big tune for many DJs for months to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGermanys Vincenzo is one of the stars of the Hamburg club scene.

The big room vibes are most definitely flowing through these 3 choice cuts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCabecudas (located in Santa Catarina, Brazil, for all you fact fans) is a track that has all the percussion-fuelled funk you could want as it builds through layers of nagging synths to a glorious hands-in-the-air crescendo in true show-stopping style. This will be a highlight in many big-room DJ sets all summer long, without a doubt. For the Vox version Smith gives the track an old-school jackin Chicago twist, bringing the percussion to the forefront and adding a memorable vocal loop hook to the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Fugitive keeps the funk-factor high and focuses on a Latin percussive vibe that cannot fail to move even the most stubborn hips as it winds up the intensity with subtle ease before unleashing yet another superb hands-in-the-air moment. This is an EP you dont want to miss out on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Smith has been at the top of his game as a DJ and producer for over a decade, but despite enjoying a global reputation as one of the most evergreen performers in his field, times have never been quite as good as they are right now. While his roots lie in techno, Christian has never been a purist, favouring instead to flavour the melodic, rhythmical music he loves with doses of funk or interspersing the raw energy of his sets with inspired moments of pure euphoria. His big-room, genre-blurring sound is very much suited to the Bedrock ethos of releasing the best quality electronic dance music that goes beyond fads and fashion as this brand new EP demonstrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the momentum of his recent successful releases firmly behind him and with the strength of fresh inspiration driving his ambition forward, the Cabecudas EP from Christian Smith shows once again why he remains at the top of his game, maintaining his relevance and position at the very pinnacle of electronic music in 2011.","id":309,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED98","released":"2011-7-4","title":"Cabecudas","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":711,"release_code":"BED98","release_id":"392113","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Cabecudas","track_length":"7:24"},{"bpm":"126","id":712,"release_code":"BED98","release_id":"392113","remix_title":"Vox Mix","title":"Cabecudas","track_length":"6:54"},{"bpm":"124","id":713,"release_code":"BED98","release_id":"392113","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Fugitive","track_length":"9:19"}]},{"artists":"Tom Middleton;Stel;Wiretappeur;Kruse & Nuernberg;Distortion;Gorge;Shonky;Martin Buttrich;Nathan Coles;David Coker;Maetrik;Sarah Goldfarb;Super Flu;Henrik Schwarz;King Unique;Ryan Davis;Dimitri Nakov;Various;Guy J;Stelios Vassiloudis;Christian Smith;John Selway;Vincenzo;Elon;Quivver;Ian O'Donovan;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Anthony Pappa;King Roc;Robert Babicz;Alan Fitzpatrick;Cari Golden;Marco Bailey;Nick Warren;Suicide Sports Club;Bedrock;Estroe;Misstress Barbara;HOSH;Ellen Allien;Marc Romboy;Stephan Bodzin;Lewis Ryder;Martin Dawson;Clement Meyer;Mylo Salte;Timo Maas;Philogresz;Ruede Hagelstein;Emmanuel Jal;Inkfish;Maxime Dangles;Tom Hades;Paneoh;Oliver Lieb;Midnight Ramblers;Dibby Dougherty;David Young;Jimmy Van M;Steve T.","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/cda149c7-3c7a-48de-a2f8-2e863fb0e6e6.jpg","description":"After months of hard work behind the scenes, the highly anticipated second installment of John Digweed's Structures is finally here, following on from 2010s debut, which was met with critical acclaim worldwide and also won the Community Choice Top DJ Mix at the Beatport Music Awards 2011. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBedrock is synonymous with releasing the highest quality forward-thinking electronic dance music and has enjoyed a highly successful 2011 so far.

The track title, 30 Northeast refers to the street address of Vagabond in Miami, USA. The club that so effectively captured the energy of a John Digweed DJ set last year, that became his first ever commercially available live DJ mix. John Digweed Live at the Vagabond, recorded live at the 9th Annual Bedrock/Creations Party at Vagabond Miami 27th March 2010, was included on the Structures bonus DVD as yet another musical milestone. A live mix complete with slideshow, it captured the essence of an amazing Bedrock Party for posterity (http://www.thevagabondmiami.com). Between them, John Digweed and Nick Muir, producers of the finest electronic dance music, have been involved in many pivotal moments in the world of club music over the years and have in many ways helped to define genres & push the boundaries further. As with all their releases, 30 Northeast is another mission statement to show that they are not resting on past laurels but always developing their sound in an exciting direction.

Along with a handful of his fellow countrymen, this young Israeli (now based in Antwerp, Belgium) is now at the forefront of a movement towards the melody-rich and emotionally charged roots of the house music spectrum. 1000 Words, spread over 3 CDs on John Digweeds forward thinking Bedrock label showcases the extraordinary talents of Guy J. His productions have constantly earned praise and gained many fans for their tight, driving beats, shimmering, warm synths and blossoming, journey like arrangements. Across 3 CDs he is given the space to explore the exciting, timeless space between ambient, experimental electronica, house, techno and beyond. Throughout, he constantly maintains a melodic and highly emotive core, creating a body of work structured and presented in a highly creative way.  CD1 gives a nod to classical composition, taking the form of a series of movements, as Guy J mixes, segues and joins the dots between individual tracks to create an end result that is greater than the sum of all its parts. Opening with a swirl of muted bells and atmospheric pads, the lush opening 3-track sequence is concluded with the gorgeous, heavenly vocals of Miriam Vaga. Just when you think you know whats coming next, the soaring, melodic shower of Fall Star, Guy J lets the spirit of the Mad Professor into the studio and spins into a fizzing dub experiment (The Right Place), before getting horizontal and beatless with the melancholy beauty of My Organ Friend, to draw the second movement to a close. Spica wouldnt be out of place on the Bladerunner movie soundtrack, as it cuts to the pulsating disco swing of Electric Tale with a nod to Giorgio Moroder and morphs and breaks down into the spiralling, ecstatic chords of Lamur, before flowing into the distant storm of a perfect sunrise moment (I Lost My Head). The majestic beats reprise of Stay Cow and the stunning finale of Fly (once gain featuring Miriam Vaga), bring to a close what can only be described as a listening experience that has been heaven sent.Imagine being able to create your perfect DJ set; having the skill as an artist to create all the music you want to play; all the subtle emotional nuances, mood swings and changes of direction at your fingertips. CD2 is packed with expansive dancefloor creations. In classic Guy J fashion this is a musically dense and diverse trip that is as dynamic as it is organic, gradually progressing, turning up the pressure, keeping you hanging on until the very last drop has poured out of the speakers!From the deep, swinging, handclapping grooves of the opening sequence of Doves, Limbo and Easy Can Be, with their subtle, uplifting, intelligent beauty, this is a true journey by DJ, a master artist at work. As the mood moves towards the deep, throbbing intensity with lights down low (My Thought Of You, Sahara and Teva), its easy to become lost in the swirling electronic music as Guy J pushes emotion buttons, exploring the psyche of the dance, exploring possibilities, forging ahead into the future. The full-length club mixes gathered on the unmixed CD3 rounds of this superb package in style, dedicated to bringing any self-respecting DJs record collection up to speed with a selection of some of Guy Js finest moments from 1000 Words. From the majestic opening notes of Doves, he first explores deep house vibes with an opening trio of low-slung grooves sprinkled with melodic flourishes, Detroit techno influences and dub drops. My Thought Of You turns up the energy levels and gets a little twisted, alongside Teva exhibiting no nonsense big room floor pressure. Sahara lightens the mood with ethereal beauty, while the stunning, gorgeous voice of Miriam Vaga will prove to be a highlight in any set anywhere.

When the fizzing tic-toc intro surges into the hook-filled melodic vibes and analogue grittiness of Henry Saizs 70s Remix, you know youre onto a winner. He even introduces a stunning slowdown half-time dub extravaganza section that shows proper remix creativity at work. Teaming up with Marc Marzenit for their Atitlan Remix, Saiz and his partner create a tight, snappy tech-edged, tension-filled builder, with lashing of funk n swing in the groove. This is one of those tracks that will take your dancefloor to the next level. Henry Saiz was born in Madrid, and is one of his countrys fastest rising future stars through his quality productions and amazing live sets. He has created his own style, a complex and emotive form of electronic club music, which brings together melody, intensity, depth and maximum attention to detail. Here, on these two remixes, he shows exactly why he is such a highly rated producer.Who is Ian ODonovan? After spending much of his youth listening to various styles of music, Ian came across the world of underground electronic music. It was so refreshing and different to all the formatted songs and cheesy dance tracks of the time, he quickly began to immerse himself in this music and the scene itself. Influenced by artists such as Steve Rachmad, Underground Resistance, Technasia and DJs like Laurent Garnier, Jeff Mills and DJ Hell, Ian began DJing and seeking out the records that would go on to play an important part in defining his sound. It wasnt until he moved to Australia in 2005, that he began to create his own tracks, slowly teaching himself and developing his sound. After nearly four years living in Oz, Ian decided to return to Ireland in 2009 and focus more of his attention on making music, determined to help break the cycle of the boring, soulless minimal fad that had dominated house and techno in previous years. With early support on many of his tracks from the likes of Laurent Garnier, John Digweed, Dave Clarke, Anderson Noise, Hernan Cattaneo, Psycatron and more, the future looks bright for Ian with hot releases like this on John Digweeds Bedrock Records.","id":316,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED90R","released":"2011-3-14","title":"Aurora Borealis Remixes","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":611,"release_code":"BED90R","release_id":"345855","remix_title":"Henry Saiz 70's Remix","title":"Aurora Borealis","track_length":"12:29"},{"bpm":"126","id":612,"release_code":"BED90R","release_id":"345855","remix_title":"Marc Marzenit & Henry Saiz Atilan Remix","title":"Aurora Borealis","track_length":"10:12"}]},{"artists":"Omid 16B","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/7a5c010a-478d-483d-a9b8-4ffe933b9f06.jpg","description":"Omid is an artist who isnt just a DJ/producer, but also a songwriter and musician who has played a range of musical instruments from an early age and has spent most of his life involved in music. Head of the SexOnWax, Disclosure and Alola labels, he is seen as a key tastemaker across the electronic music scene. As a respected artist of high calibre Omid has released several albums to critical acclaim, and released an epic number of amazing singles and remixes over the years. He has created a distinctive style and unique expression that constantly inspires, and is nothing short of a true showman. \r\n\r\nSo you can understand why this Bedrock release is going to cause a commotion.Rain was written straight after a long 60-date tour with SOS, which resulted in some key changes in Omids life, getting the balance right. Another change was, a decision that he would stop just releasing on his own labels and think of the people he would most like to work with. John Digweed heard Rain, tested it out and signed it immediately to Bedrock. Its a pure example of Omids epic musical genius, uplifting, anthemic, and downright danceable to the extreme. This is one not to be missed! \r\n\r\nThis is a master at work!But dont forget Passion of Zorro, as it pounds, sashays, flutters, and, as always with Omid, it groooooves. Through chimes, keys, percussion and an acrobatic summersault (or three) it will exhilarate dancers at every grinding turn and breakdown. For anyone who doesnt know, Zorro means fox in Spanish. However, while foxy and wise it is, not even an eagles flight could be as elegant as this melodic journey into the heart of Señor 16B. Sweaty, spirited, punchy and funky with its cascading rhythms, this is a track to get lost in .\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","id":317,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI08","released":"2011-2-28","title":"Rain / Passion Of Zorro","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":1103,"release_code":"BEDDIGI08","release_id":"337574","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Rain","track_length":"11:15"},{"bpm":"124","id":1104,"release_code":"BEDDIGI08","release_id":"337574","remix_title":"Club Mix","title":"The Passion Of Zorro","track_length":"9:48"}]},{"artists":"Marco Bailey","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/e290aee1-b946-4d76-ba66-3bc7b7d2586b.jpg","description":"Following on from his immensely popular Jungle Laps track on John Digweeds Bedrock 11 album in late 2009, the storming Watergate EP released on Bedrock earlier this year (both tracks are included here in his mix for CD2), Marco Bailey kicks off 2011 in style and passion with his highly anticipated Dragon Man artist album.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe album format gives Marco the freedom to express himself fully and include experimental down-tempo electronica, alongside his firebrand pumped up tech-house and percussive techno bombs. The opening track, Dragon Man, with its inspired melodic beauty, shows him as an artist with broad tastes and intricate creative ability. This is followed by the confusingly titled Bill The Trumpet Player, where Marco furthers his creative experiment with the introduction of a joyous uplifting live saxophone that will see plenty of action at beach parties around the globe for years to come with its housed-up percussive backbone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Rubber Band, things get gritty as the tech-vibes flow and swirling energy builds incessantly upwards into Run Through, a no-nonsense heads-down ball of emotion. By the time Bom Bang! erupts with its funked-up stroboscopic intensity, Marco Bailey is firing on all cylinders. This is a man who understands dance-floor dynamics to the max and its time to witness a master at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ambient electronic interlude of Holding The Moment allows for a brief moment of relaxation and contemplation, before the percussive fire is fuelled once more by the groovy tech-funk of Zephyr, as Marco turns up the pressure with subtle grace, lifting the energy levels with stylistic ease through Break The Rules to the heady climax of Beaming, before bringing everything to an understated relaxed finale with more experimental electronica in the shape of Red Cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immaculately mixed CD2 gives Marco Bailey the opportunity to demonstrate his dynamic DJ skills, as he weaves dextrous magic over his musical creations from CD1, with the addition of those two immensely popular previous Bedrock releases - Jungle Laps and Watergate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith moments to dream and time of dance, Dragon Man is a consummate snapshot of Belgiums finest techno DJ/Producer. Marco Bailey likes to think outside the box and explore his fascination with a diverse musical palette. His refusal to conform to a particular genre of music is both refreshing and unique. Marco Bailey is a man with a mission to entertain people with the love of techno music in all its modern guises through his unique blend of underground sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the man says...I have a burning, all consuming drive that can only be calmed down by getting into the music. Its an urge that luckily gets a positive outcome in the studio when Im working on a track just as long as it takes to get it to sound as it does in my head, or when Im puzzling on my DJ set until it releases the exact energy that makes the crowd lose it. I can best describe this burning, consuming urge as a positive disorder. Plainly positive because it gives a meaning to my life.","id":318,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDMB01","released":"2011-2-14","title":"Dragon Man","tracks":[{"bpm":"176","id":1690,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Dragon Man","track_length":"5:16"},{"bpm":"126","id":1691,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Bill The Trumpet Player","track_length":"5:39"},{"bpm":"126","id":1692,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Rubber Band","track_length":"6:20"},{"bpm":"128","id":1693,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Run Through","track_length":"6:37"},{"bpm":"128","id":1694,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Bom Bang!","track_length":"6:11"},{"bpm":"88","id":1695,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Holding The Moment","track_length":"4:35"},{"bpm":"126","id":1696,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Zephyr","track_length":"6:59"},{"bpm":"126","id":1697,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Break The Rules","track_length":"8:00"},{"bpm":"128","id":1698,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Beaming","track_length":"5:37"},{"bpm":"120","id":1699,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Red Cell","track_length":"7:12"},{"bpm":"126","id":1700,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Watergate","track_length":"6:54"},{"bpm":"126","id":1701,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Jungle Laps","track_length":"6:15"},{"bpm":"126","id":1702,"release_code":"BEDMB01","release_id":"330914","remix_title":"Continuous DJ Mix","title":"Dragon Man","track_length":"1:00:50"}]},{"artists":"Psycatron;Sian","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/c9130404-0594-48e4-93c2-9e1e63fdbe23.jpg","description":"For those of you who remember Sians outstanding Dreams Are Maps on Bedrock Digital last summer and Psycatrons stunning remix of Mutant Clans Persuader on John Digweeds Structures album, you will no doubt be chomping at the bit to get your ears around the first must-have tag-team release of 2011. This is HOT!!!!!\r\n\r\nSians feverish style and raw sound brings real voodoo to the dancefloor and his trademark aesthetics are hard to match. Regarded as one of the most promising upcoming acts in the techno scene today, Sian is already touring\r\nthe world, rocking heaving crowds and bringing his trademark experimental DJing style to the masses via multiple outputs of explosive techno,fx and loops, cut up and edited live. His tracks instantly catch the ears of\r\neveryone from John Digweed, Laurent Garnier, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Sasha, Loco Dice, Steve Bug to Carl Cox, Secret Cinema, Hernan Cattaneo, Dubfire and have shown how a genre busting talent crosses over stylistic boundaries with ease. That is why he is so suited to the Bedrock label, with its forward-thinking music policy.\r\n\r\nWhen you have interests ranging from entomology, cosmology and marine biology to psychoacoustics and the social impact of the rave generation, you tend to make unusual art. Born in Dublin, Ireland, raised gypsy style in\r\nsouthern Spain and constantly moving from city to city, Sian chose early to drop out of normal society, make music and DJ. Adhering more to the avant-garde way of life, he stands out as a little more bohemian than the\r\naverage electronic artist, a rare, flamboyant and eccentric new talent, and one we would urge you to investigate further. Sian is a truly diverse and original talent.\r\n\r\nPsycatron, aka Northern Irish duo Paul Hamill & Dave Oost Lievense, produce 21st century techno with tracks that combine relentless energy and groove with bundles of emotion and tension, to make for an all-encompassing sound that is perfect for those big arenas and club rooms. Their high profile productions are released on some of the worlds most respected labels, receiving props from some of the biggest names in the business and record sales flying high in the Beatport charts. Fergie (Rekluse), Carl Craig (Planet E), Christian Smith (Tronic), Will Saul (Simple), legendary Belgian label R&S Records, have all featured stunning Psycatron tracks, so it seems fitting that they have now linked up with Bedrock.\r\n\r\nAs the list of Psycatron supporters continues to grow, it starts to read like a whos who of quality underground electronica with everyone from Ewan Pearson to Joris Voorn, DJ Hell, Dave Clarke and even Martin L Gore\r\nfrom Depeche Mode all getting on board.","id":319,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDDIGI07","released":"2011-1-17","title":"Vertigo Of The Modern","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":53,"release_code":"BEDDIGI07","release_id":"320920","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Vertigo Of The Modern","track_length":"7:47"},{"bpm":"126","id":54,"release_code":"BEDDIGI07","release_id":"320920","remix_title":"Sian Elevator Mix","title":"Vertigo Of The Modern","track_length":"6:14"},{"bpm":"128","id":55,"release_code":"BEDDIGI07","release_id":"320920","remix_title":"Psycatron Remix","title":"Vertigo Of The Modern","track_length":"8:41"},{"bpm":"128","id":56,"release_code":"BEDDIGI07","release_id":"320920","remix_title":"Psycatron's Drum Tool","title":"Vertigo Of The Modern","track_length":"8:31"},{"bpm":"128","id":57,"release_code":"BEDDIGI07","release_id":"320920","remix_title":"Psycatron's Sub & Drum Tool","title":"Vertigo Of The Modern","track_length":"8:31"}]},{"artists":"Robert Babicz","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/7ee25cea-3862-4809-92aa-24184d04c9e6.jpg","description":"","id":320,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED96","released":"2010-12-6","title":"Pink Trees","tracks":[{"bpm":"120","id":1535,"release_code":"BED96","release_id":"310254","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Pink Trees","track_length":"8:24"},{"bpm":"124","id":1536,"release_code":"BED96","release_id":"310254","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Percofonik","track_length":"8:29"}]},{"artists":"Guy J","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/b45d7eec-05d5-4d81-a425-5de2e280d749.jpg","description":"After setting the scene alight with numerous killer singles, Israeli producer Guy J released his hotly anticipated full-length artist album 'Esperanza' on Bedrock Records in last quarter of 2008, to universal critical acclaim, and has been touring ever since around the globe. In 2009 he returned to Bedrock with yet another killer single, 'Lamur', complete with a stunning remix from one of Spain's upcoming stars, Henry Saiz. This was followed by another stunning production, 'Ballroom', later in that year. \r\n\r\nThe mighty 'Esperanza' was a highlight once again this summer when it was remixed twice, by Umbral Aguir and Sistema, for John Digweed's Structures mix album. Now Guy J returns with a highly anticipated, brand new double-header for Bedrock. Whether you go for the energetic genius of 'Heliscope' or the lush, laid-back beauty of 'Easy As Can Be', there can be no denying that Guy J is one of the stand-out electronic artists in the world today. \r\n\r\nGuy J has emerged over the course of the last few years to represent an intrinsic part of the Israeli dance music juggernaut that has been steadily powering through clubland in recent times. Along with fellow countrymen Guy Gerber, Sholmi Aber, Chaim and Gel Abril, Guy has been at the forefront of a movement back towards the melody rich sounds on which House music is based. Guy's productions, with their driving beats, shimmering synths and journey-like qualities, embody characteristics from all sub-genres of House music. Guy J creates music that is brimming with soul and the Heliscope EP is testament to that.","id":321,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED95","released":"2010-11-22","title":"Heliscope EP","tracks":[{"bpm":"127","id":477,"release_code":"BED95","release_id":"304303","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Heliscope","track_length":"8:02"},{"bpm":"123","id":478,"release_code":"BED95","release_id":"304303","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Easy As Can Be","track_length":"7:17"}]},{"artists":"Stel;Wiretappeur;Kruse & Nuernberg;Nick Muir;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/dde43247-b263-47fd-8dcf-0430eb1e2946.jpg","description":"","id":322,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BILDER01","released":"2010-11-8","title":"Bilder","tracks":[{"bpm":"127","id":367,"release_code":"BILDER01","release_id":"298598","remix_title":"Club Mix","title":"Bilder","track_length":"11:58"},{"bpm":"127","id":368,"release_code":"BILDER01","release_id":"298598","remix_title":"Wiretappeur Remix","title":"Bilder","track_length":"7:59"},{"bpm":"127","id":369,"release_code":"BILDER01","release_id":"298598","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Bilder","track_length":"6:43"}]},{"artists":"Martin Buttrich;Nick Warren","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/6045f828-1089-4396-a1a9-cd7950f6fac9.jpg","description":"","id":323,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED94","released":"2010-10-25","title":"In Search Of Silver","tracks":[{"bpm":"124","id":1605,"release_code":"BED94","release_id":"292202","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"In Search Of Silver","track_length":"9:56"},{"bpm":"124","id":1606,"release_code":"BED94","release_id":"292202","remix_title":"Martin Buttrich Remix","title":"In Search Of Silver","track_length":"11:02"},{"bpm":"124","id":1607,"release_code":"BED94","release_id":"292202","remix_title":"Martin Buttrich Dub","title":"In Search Of Silver","track_length":"7:14"},{"bpm":"124","id":1608,"release_code":"BED94","release_id":"292202","remix_title":"Martin Buttrich Tool","title":"In Search Of Silver","track_length":"4:10"},{"bpm":"124","id":1609,"release_code":"BED94","release_id":"292202","remix_title":"Ambient Mix","title":"In Search Of Silver","track_length":"5:23"}]},{"artists":"Luis Junior;Diyo;Maetrik;Sistema;Stel;Nils Nuernberg;Florian Kruse;Wiretappeur;Vincenzo;Lovebirds;Quivver;Misstress Barbara;King Unique;Anthony Pappa;Max Cooper;Christian Smith;Tone Depth;Nick Warren;Nick Muir;John Digweed;Alan Fitzpatrick;Wehbba;Robert Babicz","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/857637ae-4671-43e2-ad76-77526e5d1a03.jpg","description":"To celebrate Bedrocks 12th anniversary, John Digweed has compiled 21 outstanding exclusive tracks and remixes from established and new artists to form Bedrock 12.

The full original version was then unleashed in its own right as a single, along with counterpart Meteor, gaining big support from the like of Carl Cox, Fergie, Desyn Masiello, Hernan Cattaneo, Anderson Noise, Sasha, and many more.Now, just when you thought you could sit down for a rest, Satellite has received some superb heavy-duty treatment in the remix department from the highly exciting Maetrik, and a top notch big room makeover from Tronic main man, Christian Smith. Maetrik shows exactly why hes such an exciting prospect with a stunning low-slung seriously heavy-duty groove that cant fail to impress. Originally from the USA and now relocated to Valencia Spain, Maetrik (aka Eric Estornel) is making incredible leaps and bounds, creating some of the most devastating and unique music right now with his unique blend of techno, house, funk, and electro. Maybe its down to his Cuban roots? Maybe its down to his desire to crush genre boundaries? Whatever the reason, John Digweed has made a smart creative call by letting him loose on Satellite!The big room vibes are most definitely flowing with Christian Smiths remix of Satellite, as he weaves and winds together over ten minutes of epic genre blurring wonder. Mr Smith has been championing his essentially funky mix of house and techno for more than a decade now, creating a highly individual cauldron of chunky grooves with loads of energy. With his own Tronic label releasing some fine fare right now, its no wonder that he was feeling inspired to deliver this superb version of Satellite.Between them, John Digweed and Nick Muir, producers of the finest electronic dance music, have been involved in many pivotal moments in the world of club music and have in many ways helped to define genres & push the boundaries further over the years. As with all their releases, Satellite / Meteor is a mission statement to show that they are not resting on past laurels but always developing their sound in an exciting direction.

When the combined energies of two very different people come together in a studio something magical happens and they also have a lot of fun. Dimitri Nakov and Martin Dawson (King Roc) are\r\ntwo very exciting young producers with very different approaches to music and sampling, and their combined energies has created something glorious & original called Sao Paulo Nights for John Digweeds ever impressive\r\nand diverse musical melting pot, Bedrock.\r\n\r\nMartin and Dimitri met a couple of years ago, at Universo Paralelo in Bahia, Brazil at New Year (always an amazing festival). Musically, they found they had a lot in common and over the course of the next two years they kept\r\nbumping into each other at gigs until they finally bumped into each other on an Iberia flight to Sao Paulo late last year. Having a couple of days to kill while in Brazil they sat in a friends studio after dinner one night and Martin started tinkering. Dimitri said.. \"record!\" and delved into his\r\nsample and funk and disco collection, and 2 days, or rather, nights later they had created the two tracks that are Sao Paulo Nights, which they then recorded at Dimitris friend Gabe's studio in Jardins in Sao Paulo.\r\n\r\nMartin Dawson + Dimitri Nakov = Very Exciting Music\r\n\r\nWorking under the name King Roc, Martin Dawson released his debut album in 2009 to critical acclaim from the international dance music press including album of the month in DJ Mag and 10/10 from IDJ Mag. He was nominated by DJ Mag for best UK producer and best artist album 2009 along the likes of Jamie Jones and Scream. His solo a co-productions have been supported by many dance music artists such as Laurent Garnier, Tiefschwarz, Radioslave, D'Julz, Solomon, Nick Curly and Luciano to name a few. He also records under the name Two Armadillos with Giles Smith from secretsundaze, London hes worked with labels such as Bang!Bang!, Dessous, STHLM Audio, Buzzin' Fly and Four:Twenty with remixes for Moodmusic, R&S and Fear Of Flying, and\r\nDJs Deep House and Techno all around the world.\r\n\r\nDimitri Nakov moved to Brazil in 2001 after a few good years in the UK dance scene and a handful of unique experiences working and DJ'ing with Sasha, running Narcotic Records (Roger Sanchez's UK based label) and promoting artists such as Robert Miles, during the \"Children\" heyday, Dimitri inevitably became an integral part of the burgeoning electronic music scene based in Sao Paulo. Regularly playing events topping 10-20 000 people across the globe, especially in Brazil (Creamfields & Xxxperience), and Big Beach (Japan). Dimitri has always also been keen to play smaller, more intimate gigs like D.Edge (Sao Paulo) and De Puta Madre (Belo Horizonte), which is widely regarded as one of Brazil's best clubs, alongside Warung (which Dimitri has also played at). Back in Europe at present, and based in Ibiza, Dimitri has become a regular guest on David Moreno's show on Ibiza Global Radio, while also achieving an unofficial residency with Sasha last year at Cream at Amnesia, and playing internationally at Sonar, Urban Artforms Festival, The Glade Festival and touring with Layo & Bushwacka and Luciano\r\nin Japan. Dimitri's other recent musical adventures include remixes of Sashas \"Park It In The Shade\" and \"Coma\", and \"Move!\" by Smith & Selway\r\n\r\nRumours that Martin and Dimitri will be meeting up in their respective Berlin or Ibiza studios shortly for part 2, will be met with much excitement on the basis of this Sao Paolo Nights collaboration.

Both tracks have been severely road tested by me and are best suited for peak time madness. - John Digweed\r\n\r\nMatt Thomas (aka King Unique) kicks off his tenth year at the forefront of the British house scene with a new direction & a new single, the double-header, 2000000 Suns / Feniksas. Walking the fine line that prevails between techno, house and progressive KUs self-dubbed cosmic techno sound has found its perfect home on a favourite label - John Digweeds Bedrock.\r\n\r\nJohns been a big supporter of KU for the last few years and I think Bedrock has been one of the best labels of the last couple of years. Plus everyone on Bedrock has great hair like me so it was a natural choice. - Matt Thomas\r\n\r\nWith words of wisdom aplenty, it makes (non)sense to let Matt carry on...\r\n\r\n2000000 Suns was an early guess at the mass of the black hole that has been found at the centre of our galaxy. I heard about it while I was recording the track and it instantly made me think about those old house music clichés of unity and oneness. Its an inescapable fact that at a molecular level, all of us, you, me and every single person, animal & object that has ever existed on this planet are all going to meet again (in the best traditions of Vera Lynn) in that black hole - along with a few hundred billion other stars and their planets. We truly will be one.\r\n\r\nThe track itself is a huge stellar affair, pressing the same melodic & psychedelic buttons that made KUs recent Heavy Drug remix for UNKLE an epic peak-time fixture for Sasha & Digweed, and drew support from Mr Deep Space himself, the legendary François Kevorkian. On the flip-side the techno takes the upper hand over the cosmic vibe on Feniksas, a piece of retro-techno that found its way back to the future. Once again, Matt sheds some light on the tracks origins\r\n\r\nIts a tune that's taken a little while to finish - about 7 years, in fact. It was originally written in 2003 for an album that was never released, and ended up forgotten on a dusty hard-drive. Last summer I found an unfinished copy on my old laptop - and by unfinished I mean the track literally stopped halfway through. When I heard it again I thought it sounded pretty good, a little time capsule of techno from the days before minimal, but I didnt really consider releasing it until I played it to Ignas (the promoter of Exit Club in Lithuania). We were talking about classic big room tracks on the ichat , so I told him I had one that nobody had ever heard & sent him a copy. And he liked it. Really liked it :) That made me think seriously about releasing it; I took it back to the studio, finished it and passed a copy to Fergie and John Digweed John asked to sign it and Ferg asked to remix it - so I said yes twice :) Thats how the tune finally made it out of the laptop and became Feniksas - reborn in Lithuania, and re-titled to say thank you to the Lietuviai for bringing the tune back.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt this is a huge package from King Unique & Bedrock, so if the cosmic techno sound is pressing all the right melodic & psychedelic buttons for you & youre feeling that retro-techno goodness, spread the word!","id":338,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED86","released":"2010-3-1","title":"2000000 Suns / Feniksas","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":672,"release_code":"BED86","release_id":"224414","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"2000000 Suns","track_length":"9:38"},{"bpm":"99","id":673,"release_code":"BED86","release_id":"224414","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Feniksas","track_length":"8:21"}]},{"artists":"Luis Junior","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/798eff70-adab-4aae-9d86-d07a9c06c911.jpg","description":"Luis Junior is getting a lot of attention with his upcoming EP, on Bedrock Records \"Colache\", which has already been included on Global Underground's Nu Breed CD mixed by Sultan.

Earlier\r\nin 2009 he returned to Bedrock with yet another killer single, ‘Lamur’,\r\ncomplete with a stunning remix from one of Spain’s upcoming stars, Henry\r\nSaiz.

Along with fellow countrymen Guy\r\nGerber, Sholmi Aber, Chaim and Gel Abril, Guy has been at the forefront of a\r\nmovement back towards the melody rich sounds on which House music is based.\r\nGuy’s productions, with their driving beats, shimmering synths and\r\njourney-like qualities, embody characteristics from all sub-genres of House\r\nmusic.

Recent remixes for Len Faki on Cocoon, and now his 'Tribute Mix'\r\nof Guy J’s 'Ballroom' show just how exciting a remix talent he is.\r\n\r\nBorn in Dublin Ireland, raised gypsy style in southern Spain and constantly\r\nmoving cities, Sian chose early to drop out of society, make music and DJ.\r\nCommitting to the avant-garde way of life, he stands out as a little more\r\nbohemian than the average electronic figure..a very rare, flamboyant and\r\neccentric new talent. Recording primarily for Dubfires highly respected\r\nSci&Tec label and Will Saul’s Aus Music imprint, he has also appeared on\r\nPokerflat, Karmarouge, Dessous and Mule.

Now he returns to Bedrock in 2009 with yet another killer single, ‘Lamur’, complete with a stunning remix from one of Spain’s upcoming stars, Henry Saiz.\r\n\r\nGuy J has emerged over the course of the last two years to represent an intrinsic part of the Israeli dance music juggernaut that has been steadily powering through clubland in recent times. Along with fellow countrymen Guy Gerber, Sholmi Aber, Chaim and Gel Abril, Guy has been at the forefront of a movement back towards the melody rich sounds on which House music is based. Guy’s productions, with their driving beats, shimmering synths and journey-like qualities, embody characteristics from all sub-genres of House music. Guy J creates music that is brimming with soul.\r\n\r\nHenry Saiz was born in Madrid, and is one of his country’s fastest rising future stars through his quality productions and amazing live sets. 2007 was a breakthrough year for this young star, taking his live show around Europe. He has created his own style, a complex and emotive form of electronic club music which brings together melody, intensity, depth and maximum attention to detail. His original productions on esteemed Spanish labels Natura Sonoris, Paradigma Musik & Software, were picked up by John Digweed for his recent compilation: Transitions Vol.4, and he’s the perfect choice to remix ‘Lamur’.","id":352,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED79","released":"2009-5-11","title":"Lamur","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":977,"release_code":"BED79","release_id":"169685","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Lamur","track_length":"7:13"},{"bpm":"127","id":978,"release_code":"BED79","release_id":"169685","remix_title":"Henry Saiz Remix","title":"Lamur","track_length":"10:10"}]},{"artists":"Tom Stephan;Kamisshake;Pete Heller","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/48686634-e072-4eaa-87c3-9ff9d5487775.jpg","description":"","id":353,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED78","released":"2009-3-30","title":"Sabotage","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":322,"release_code":"BED78","release_id":"164050","remix_title":"Pete Heller's Phelacid Mix","title":"Sabotage","track_length":"10:43"},{"bpm":"126","id":323,"release_code":"BED78","release_id":"164050","remix_title":"Tom Stephan's ChumboMundo Mix","title":"Sabotage","track_length":"8:15"},{"bpm":"125","id":324,"release_code":"BED78","release_id":"164050","remix_title":"Kamisshake Remix","title":"Sabotage","track_length":"7:40"}]},{"artists":"Alan Fitzpatrick;Nick Muir;John Digweed","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/11aa1def-48da-40d3-8dc9-9ce934355d37.jpg","description":"","id":354,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED77","released":"2009-2-23","title":"Aquatonic","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":138,"release_code":"BED77","release_id":"158524","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Aquatonic","track_length":"8:19"},{"bpm":"126","id":139,"release_code":"BED77","release_id":"158524","remix_title":"Alan Fitzpatrick Remix","title":"Aquatonic","track_length":"7:26"}]},{"artists":"Guy J","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/471f3a21-6bd3-43b7-9d91-9e57910eca92.jpg","description":"","id":355,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED76","released":"2008-12-1","title":"Fall Star / Lunar","tracks":[{"bpm":"125","id":926,"release_code":"BED76","release_id":"147084","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Fall Star","track_length":"7:56"},{"bpm":"126","id":927,"release_code":"BED76","release_id":"147084","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Lunar","track_length":"9:17"}]},{"artists":"John Digweed;Estroe;Charlie May;Chab;Jamie Stevens;Bruce Aisher;Danny Howells;James Talk;M.O.D.E.;Tom Middleton;Paolo Mojo;Kazell;Alan Fitzpatrick;WiNK;Jim Rivers;Guy Gerber;Seizmic;Various Artists;Fortunato & Montresor;Pole Folder;CP;Tom Mangan;Steve Lawler;Bedrock;Gutterstylz;Science Dept.;Nick Muir;Guy J;Saints & Sinners;Moonface;Shmuel Flash;Misstress Barbara;Bradler;Dualton;Morgan Page;Gregory Shiff;Funk D'Void;Toby Izui;Pindrop","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/471f3a21-6bd3-43b7-9d91-9e57910eca92.jpg","description":"So to ‘Bedrock 10 Past present and Future ` and to honour this massive occasion John has drafted in a careful selection of remix heavyweights to shed new light on some of the labels biggest tracks along with a tidy fistful of the labels freshest output all blended to perfection in the inimitable John Digweed mixing style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCD1 delves deep into the Bedrock mines and strikes gold with Tom Mangan giving his mind-blowing 2001 cut ‘Chutney’ a hefty face-lift, Steve Lawler re-interpreting his own ‘Rise In’ and Danny Howells doing a tasty number on Science Department’s ‘Repercussion’. The disc culminates in M.O.D.E. turning in a fine remix of Bedrock’s ‘Heaven Scent’ which is no mean feat given the track’s gargantuan standing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCD2 More full on and peak time this CD faces forward whilst reflectively signalling a nod to past greats. Guy J makes his presence felt among his long-established, production contemporaries on ‘Lunar’, Bruce Aisher takes on and wins against Saints and Sinners ‘Pushin Too Hard’ and Christian Smith demonstrates a lesson in subtly destroying a dance floor with his summer-smash ‘Flyertalk’ and Josh wink under his size 9 Moniker delivers an unreal remix of ‘Chutney’.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCD3 is an Unmixed affair and features original tracks from Funk d Void, Jim Rivers and Charlie May (Pindrop) and also features unreleased remixes from Guy Gerber, POB, and Chab to name a few, making this not just a bonus disc, but an absolute must have for Bedrock fans.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Bedrock 10’ perfectly encapsulates the essence of one of the world’s leading labels by refusing to simply compile a ‘greatest hits’ CD and therefore continuing in the pioneering spirit on which the label is based.","id":356,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BEDPPF10","released":"2008-10-13","title":"Bedrock 10:  Past Present Future","tracks":[{"bpm":"130","id":1884,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Seismic Dub","title":"Emerald","track_length":"8:21"},{"bpm":"121","id":1885,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Continuous DJ Mix","title":"Past Present Future (Part 1)","track_length":"1:14:14"},{"bpm":"94","id":1886,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Estroe Remix","title":"Imagine","track_length":"6:23"},{"bpm":"120","id":1887,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Charlie Mayhem Cold Shoulder Dub","title":"Dust","track_length":"9:00"},{"bpm":"111","id":1888,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Tom Mangan 2008 Remix","title":"Chutney","track_length":"8:03"},{"bpm":"124","id":1889,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Steve Lawler Powder Powder Remix","title":"Rise In","track_length":"11:52"},{"bpm":"126","id":1890,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Chab Remix","title":"Santiago","track_length":"8:42"},{"bpm":"125","id":1891,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Jamie Stevens Remix","title":"Warung Beach","track_length":"8:36"},{"bpm":"0","id":1892,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Seismic Dub","title":"Emerald","track_length":"7:44"},{"bpm":"127","id":1893,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Bruce Aisher's Resurrection Rewind Mix","title":"Dirtbox","track_length":"9:54"},{"bpm":"128","id":1894,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"Danny Howells Remix","title":"Repercussion","track_length":"7:19"},{"bpm":"125","id":1895,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"John Digweed & Nick Muir's Even Stranger Remix","title":"Beautiful Strange","track_length":"8:05"},{"bpm":"127","id":1896,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"James Talk Remix","title":"Save Me","track_length":"11:15"},{"bpm":"126","id":1897,"release_code":"BEDPPF10","release_id":"138250","remix_title":"M.O.D.E.

Firstly, Inner Turmoil has been picked up and given a much groovier feel. Rolling bass and harder beats turned this into a dance floor demon. A very versatile record to be dropped as an intro, peak time monster or an outro!\r\nScared to Lose has been given the breaks twist, on of the best records on the album, Pole Folder and CP reconstruct a floaty breaks track with a real punch.

Dreamy pads and spacey synths chime in over a rolling, intelligent deep house beat and sounds gliding in and out over the top of the track. 'Fever' on the flip is a deeper more driving affair. Well produced beats and punchy bass open the track which slowly builds in true Yunus fashion. Trancy, stabby strings occupy the breakdown which builds into a crescendo of pads, bongos, vocal cuts and a fantastic bass hook. Yunus Guvenen took Bedrock to new levels in 2003 with his Invasion EP and he's set to do it again with this fantastic release.","id":381,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED 61","released":"2005-9-26","title":"Let Go / Fever","tracks":[{"bpm":"126","id":1506,"release_code":"BED 61","release_id":"1009","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Let Go","track_length":"12:20"},{"bpm":"128","id":1507,"release_code":"BED 61","release_id":"1009","remix_title":"Original Mix","title":"Fever","track_length":"10:47"}]},{"artists":"Max Graham;Tom Mangan;Guy Gerber","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/471f3a21-6bd3-43b7-9d91-9e57910eca92.jpg","description":"","id":382,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED55R","released":"2005-7-29","title":"Stoppage Time (Remixes)","tracks":[{"bpm":"128","id":1041,"release_code":"BED55R","release_id":"1008","remix_title":"Max Graham Sidechain Mix","title":"Stoppage Time","track_length":"8:44"},{"bpm":"127","id":1042,"release_code":"BED55R","release_id":"1008","remix_title":"Tom Mangan Mix","title":"Stoppage Time","track_length":"8:01"}]},{"artists":"Luke Chable;Terry Grant","artwork":"https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/250x250/471f3a21-6bd3-43b7-9d91-9e57910eca92.jpg","description":"","id":383,"labels":"Bedrock Records","release_code":"BED59R","released":"2005-7-28","title":"I'll Kill You (Chable Mixes)","tracks":[{"bpm":"129","id":1688,"release_code":"BED59R","release_id":"1007","remix_title":"Luke Chable Mix","title":"I'll Kill You feat.
